# AI Brainstorming Exercise with Gemini - Doomscrolling

## Objective
- Learn how to use AI as a creative thinking partner to develop app/product ideas
- We'll all tackle the same problem today to learn the process - next week you'll use these skills for Project 1!

---

## Setup (5 minutes)
1. **Open your browser and go to:** [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com/)
2. **Sign in with your RIT Google account** (important for free features!)
3. **Look for "Guided Learning" mode** (look under "tools", may be a toggle or option in settings)
4. **Have our Slack open in another tab** - you'll share at the end

## Part 1: Understanding the Problem (7 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable Guided Learning and start the conversation
Copy and paste this prompt:
```
I want to design a solution for college students struggling with excessive Doomscrolling on their personal devices. 
Help me understand this problem better by asking me questions about how doomscrolling effects a typical college student.
```

### Step 2: Engage with Gemini's questions
- Answer honestly about YOUR experience (or a Doomscroller you personally know)
- Let it ask you 3-4 follow-up questions
- Notice how it's helping you think deeper about the problem
- **Save interesting insights it helps you discover**

---

## Part 2: Generating Solutions (8 minutes)

### Step 3: Brainstorm with guidance
Now prompt:
```
Based on our discussion, give me 10 creative solutions including:
- 3 practical mobile app ideas
- 3 completely ridiculous but funny ideas
- 2 physical products
- 2 social or service-based solutions

After showing me the list, help me pick the most interesting one to develop further.
```

### Step 4: Develop YOUR favorite
- Pick the idea that makes you laugh or think "that could actually work!"
- Tell Gemini which one and answer its follow-up questions
- Add your own twist or feature idea when it asks
- Give your solution a catchy name

### Step 5: Make it specific
Ask Gemini:
```
My solution is called [YOUR NAME FOR IT]. 
Help me define:
- Who EXACTLY would use this? (be specific - not just "students")
- What's the #1 feature that would make it actually helpful?
- What would make it FUN or addictive to use daily?
```

## Part 3: Visualize Your Idea (5 minutes)

### Step 6: Create a visual
Try ONE of these prompts:

**Option A - Logo:**
```
Create a logo for an app called [YOUR APP NAME] that [brief description of what it does]
```

**Option B - Interface:**
```
Show me what the main screen would look like for [YOUR APP NAME]
```

**Option C - Product Design:**
```
Create a product design sketch for [YOUR PHYSICAL PRODUCT NAME]
```

### Step 7: (Optional) Try Canvas Mode
If you see a "Canvas" or code option:
```
Create a simple HTML landing page for [YOUR APP NAME] with:
- A catchy headline
- 3 feature boxes
- A fun call-to-action button
Make it colorful and playful!
```
Take a screenshot if you like the result!

## Part 4: Share Your Creation (5 minutes)

### Step 8: Post to Slack
1. Go to our class Slack → #section-[your section number] channel
2. Find my message: "Share your Doomscrolling solution here!"
3. **Click in the thread** (hover over message → "Reply in thread")
4. Post:
   - **App/Product Name:** [Your creative name]
   - **One-liner:** [What it does in one fun sentence]
   - **Key insight:** [Something interesting Gemini helped you realize]
   - **Image:** Upload your logo/mockup (if you like it)
   
### Step 9: Engage with others
- React with emojis to ideas you love
- Comment on at least one other person's idea
- Vote for "Most Practical" and "Most Ridiculous" with reactions!

## Tips for Success
✅ **Don't just take Gemini's first suggestion** - push back, ask for variations, add your own ideas

✅ **Be specific** - "tired students" → "night-owl gamers who stay up until 4am"

✅ **Have fun with it** - the sillier ideas often lead to the best insights

✅ **Save your chat** - You'll submit this for participation credit

---

## What to Submit (End of Class)
In the myCourses dropbox "AI Brainstorming Exercise":
1. Copy/paste your final app/product description
2. Paste the link to your Gemini chat (click "Share" in Gemini)
3. Answer: Which AI response surprised you most and why? (2-3 sentences)

## Remember
This is practice for Project 1! Next week you'll use these same techniques with your group to develop your app proposal. The goal today is to learn HOW to use AI as a creative partner, not just an answer machine.

**Questions?** Ask me or your neighbor - this is all about learning together!
