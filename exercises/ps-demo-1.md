# Adobe Photoshop demo

(for *Visual Design: Typography Core Concepts* assignment)

- Make a new document: **File > New...** 
  - 8"x10" 300PPI ("pixels per inch") is a good size for print - it works out to 2400x3000 pixels
  - set the size and background color when you create the document (over on right of dialog box)
  - maybe 1200 x 1500 pixels is good enough for the screen? Let's change it
  - BTW - you can resize the document at any time under the **Image > Canvas Size...** menu
  - BTW - you can change the background color at any time - https://www.wikihow.com/Change-the-Background-Color-in-Photoshop
- Zooming in and out is helpful:
  - look under the **View** menu
  - look for the **Zoom Tool** (Magnifying Glass) on the left toolbar
  - look for the **Fit Screen** button
  - "Z" key is a shortcut to the Zoom tool
- "T" key for the **Text* tool, or click the **T** icon in toolbar
  - set text font, color, alignment and other characteristics in menus at top of document
  - check the **Layers** over on the right, any text we make is created on a new layer, which we can rearrange or hide
- The "Move" tool ("M" key) can be used to move text (or images) around
- You can paste bitmapped images directly into a Photoshop document
  - to scale or otherwise transform a selected image, use the **Edit > Free Transform...** or **Edit > Transform...** menu
- Use the "H" key to get back to the default **Hand** tool
- **File > Save** and save your source file as a .psd source file with all layer info and meta data saved
- **File > Save As...** and choose "PDF" to save your source file as a "flattened" file
- **File > Export > Export as...** to choose a format such as PNG or JPEG
- **File > Export > Save for Web (Legacy)...** for even more image options
