# Week 11A

## I. Project 3: Interactive Digital Prototype - Resources & Status Check

### New Resource: Infographic Directory
- **Good news:** The [complete infographic directory](https://github.com/jptweb/IGME-110-Fall-2025/blob/main/documents/infographics-organized/README.md) is now available for all sections!
- While it may be too late to drastically change your initial plan (which is fine!), it can still be helpful for:
  - **Inspiration** for your wireframes and visual design
  - **Seeing how other students interpreted** the same app proposals
  - **Getting ideas** for how to visually represent features
- **You're not required** to base your work on the infographics - they're just another resource available to you
- **Cool bonus:** See how others used YOUR app proposal to develop their infographic! Only a small handful of app proposals didn't get converted at least once
- Note: If you find broken links or one pointing to a reflection instead of an infographic, let me know and I'll fix it ASAP

### Status Check
1. [P3 - Get in Teams & Topic list](../documents/p3-teams.md) (we did this class 10B on thursday)
2. [P3 - Deliverable 1: Work Plan, Features & Personas](../documents/p3-work-plan.md) (we started this on Thursday last week and was due before the start of todays class)
3. **👉 YOU ARE HERE:** [P3 - Deliverable 2: Lo-Fi mockups and in-class testing](../documents/p3-lofi-deliverable.md)
   - **Due:** Prior to start of next class (Tuesday Nov 5 at 8:00am for Section 8, Thursday Nov 5 at 2:00pm for Section 2)
   - These are team dropboxes so only one submission needed.
4. [P3 - Deliverable 3: Hi-Fi Version and in-class testing](../documents/p3-hifi-deliverable.md) (we start this on Nov 5th)
5. (coming soon) P3 - Peer eval and other miscellaneous things as needed.

## II. P3 Deliverable #1 Debrief - Team Dynamics & Assignment Completion

### Team Contribution Issues
- I heard from one group that team members weren't contributing equally
- **This is essential to address:** Contribute to your team OR reach out to me **before** it becomes last minute
- **Why teamwork matters:**
  - Real-world skill, especially as AI handles individual tasks
  - State-accredited course requirement (not optional)
  - BUT - I want to be fair to those actually contributing

### Practical Strategies for Team Accountability
Want some concrete ways to handle challenging group members? Check out this article: [The Best Ways To Deal With Challenging Group Members](https://medium.com/@outright.concepts/the-best-ways-to-deal-with-challenging-group-members-f53d93eb4753)

**Key tactics we'll discuss:**
- **Set expectations early** - First meeting: discuss strengths, weaknesses, communication preferences
- **Create roles** - Team Leader, Recorder, Time-Keeper, Editor, Researcher (adapt to your needs)
- **Document contributions** - Keep a shared log for peer evaluations
- **Set "ghost dates"** - Internal deadline 3 days before actual due date
- **Use review checkpoints** - Don't wait until the end to discover problems

### My Grading Policy
- I reserve the right to grade individuals separately with **documented** patterns of MIA behavior
- Since we're all adults, teams should work issues out internally first...
- If someone isn't responding for 48+ hours, THEN loop me in
- **Use peer evaluation forms** - they exist for this reason and DO impact grades

### One-Time Resubmission for Deliverable #1
- If your team **completely botched** the Work Plan/Features/Personas, you may resubmit by **midnight tonight**
- **Trade-offs:**
  - ONE-TIME offer (not available for future assignments)
  - Eats into Deliverable #2 time (due next class)
  - All team members get same grade (you had extra time to coordinate)

### Missing Assignment Components = Lost Points
- **Pattern I'm seeing:** P2 Infographics had missing parts - people not following all steps
- Every assignment has multiple pieces:
  - Main deliverable (design, prototype, etc.)
  - Documentation (work plans, reflections)
  - Process artifacts (drafts, peer evals)
- **Documentation pads your grade** - but you can have perfect work and poor grade if you skip it
- **Before submitting:** Check myCourses rubrics for ALL required components

**Ask questions BEFORE due dates, not after!**

## III. User Flow 
- This is step #1 from the [UI/UX Design Process Overview](10B.md#iii-uiux-design-process-overview) from last time
- For deliverable #2, you are going to look at each user persona
  - the *primary user*, *power user* and *casual user* ...
  - and think about the most common tasks each user will want to perform with your app (based on that app's features!), in order to meet their goals ...
  - and write them down
- You will then create user flow diagrams for each user - at least five for your *primary user*, and at least two more each for your *power user* and *casual user*
  - that adds up to a minimum of NINE unique user flow diagrams

### What Makes a Good User Flow Diagram?
Your (simplified, high-level) user flow diagrams need:
  - a **title** that explains the user action (ex. ***"Change shock intensity"***)
  - an **entry point** (ex. ***"App Home Screen"***)
  - a **series of steps** the user will need to take
    - ex. ***"Find Settings Button"*** ➡️ ***"Navigate to Settings Screen"*** ➡️ ***"Change Intensity to Desired Level"***
  - an **end success state** (ex. ***"Confirm Change"***)
 
- For our purposes, a simplified version like this is fine:

![screenshot](../documents/_images/user-flow-diagram.png)

This shows you exactly what 9 user flows look like for different personas (Primary, Power, and Casual users), with examples you can adapt to your own app.

#### \*\*\* IMPORTANT - USER FLOW DIAGRAMS ARE OFTEN MORE FINE-GRAINED AND DETAILED ... \*\*\*

- and reflect decision points and error states

  - https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/design-user-flows-with-examples/

---

## III. Scenario-Based Usability Testing
- Of the 9 user flow diagrams you created, choose at least 5 tasks that you would like to see your users perform
- Now create app "screens" that map to these "user flows" you chose
 
---

## IV. BTW - Why Do User Testing?

- [Study Guide 11: User Testing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f5h_8OBTGzORzFFOK5QamQqt4XgW4_Xe_ERmpZ9bmU0/edit?usp=sharing)

## V. Testing with paper prototypes (OR low-fidelity digital wireframes)

- Things we can get feedback on:
  - the screen layout - does it make sense to users?
  - content & information architecture
  - interaction designs
  - task flows
  - missing features!
- Prepare for the user test:
  - gather materials for production and iteration
  - use one sheet of paper to wireframe each screen 
  - create an "under construction" page for any time a user clicks on a link or button to something you haven't implemented yet (that's an extra, 6th screen)
  - create a list of tasks for the user to perform
  - assign the 3 roles for the testers:
    - *Facilitator* - interviews/instructs the user, does nearly all of the talking
    - *Computer* - *when the user taps with the finger on a paper "screen" in front of her, the "computer" picks up the page representing the response and places it in front of the user*
    - *Scribe* - writes down responses to questions
- Create the tests:
  - use a version of the [provided testing template (script)](../documents/p3-wireframe-feedback-script.md)
  - customize the tasks and follow-up for your team's app
- Run the tests (we are doing this next time):
  - One copy of script per user
  - Between tests, be prepared to update screens or create new screens to fix obvious usability issues or missing features


---

## VI. More testing - Techniques for Discovering Missing Features
- So now you've tested at least 5 user flows - which may or may not have gone flawlessly
- But what about all of the things you DIDN'T test?
  - were there things your users want to do while testing these flows that you did not anticipate? For example, filtering results by price or date
  - are there key app features that you did NOT create user flows for? For example, the ability to bookmark and share a search result
- Here are the techniques we'll be using, see the script template linked above
  - Scenario-Based Testing
  - The "Think Aloud" Protocol
  - The Post-Task Expectation Interview
  - The Magic Wand Question
