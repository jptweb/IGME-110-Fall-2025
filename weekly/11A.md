# Week 11A - Creating Your Lo-Fi Prototype & Testing Materials

## I. Project 3: Interactive Digital Prototype - Resources & Status Check

### New Resource: Infographic Directory
- **Good news:** The [complete infographic directory](https://github.com/jptweb/IGME-110-Fall-2025/blob/main/documents/infographics-organized/README.md) is now available for all sections!
- While it may be too late to drastically change your initial plan (which is fine!), it can still be helpful for:
  - **Inspiration** for your wireframes and visual design
  - **Seeing how other students interpreted** the same app proposals
  - **Getting ideas** for how to visually represent features
- **You're not required** to base your work on the infographics - they're just another resource available to you
- **Cool bonus:** See how others used YOUR app proposal to develop their infographic! Only a small handful of app proposals didn't get converted at least once
- Note: If you find broken links or one pointing to a reflection instead of an infographic, let me know and I'll fix it ASAP

### Status Check: Where We Are in P3
1. ✅ [P3 - Get in Teams & Topic list](../documents/p3-teams.md) (we did this class 10B on Thursday)
2. ✅ [P3 - Deliverable 1: Work Plan, Features & Personas](../documents/p3-work-plan.md) (started Thursday, was due before today's class)
3. **👉 YOU ARE HERE:** [P3 - Deliverable 2: Lo-Fi mockups and in-class testing](../documents/p3-lofi-deliverable.md)
   - **Due:** Prior to start of next class (Tuesday Nov 5 at 8:00am for Section 8, Thursday Nov 5 at 2:00pm for Section 2)
   - These are team dropboxes so only one submission needed
   - **What happens next class:** You'll TEST these materials with other teams
4. [P3 - Deliverable 3: Hi-Fi Version and in-class testing](../documents/p3-hifi-deliverable.md) (we start this after completing testing)
5. (coming soon) P3 - Peer eval and other miscellaneous things as needed

## II. P3 Deliverable #1 Debrief - Team Dynamics & Assignment Completion

### Team Contribution Issues
- I heard from one group that team members weren't contributing equally
- **This is essential to address:** Contribute to your team OR reach out to me **before** it becomes last minute
- **Why teamwork matters:**
  - Real-world skill, especially as AI handles individual tasks
  - State-accredited course requirement (not optional)
  - BUT - I want to be fair to those actually contributing

**Key tactics we'll discuss:**
- **Set expectations early** - First meeting: discuss strengths, weaknesses, communication preferences
- **Create roles** - Team Leader, Recorder, Time-Keeper, Editor, Researcher (adapt to your needs)
- **Document contributions** - Keep a shared log for peer evaluations
- **Set "ghost dates"** - Internal deadline 3 days before actual due date
- **Use review checkpoints** - Don't wait until the end to discover problems

### My Grading Policy
- I reserve the right to grade individuals separately with **documented** patterns of MIA behavior
- Since we're all adults, teams should work issues out internally first
- If someone isn't responding for 48+ hours, THEN loop me in
- **Use peer evaluation forms** - they exist for this reason and DO impact grades

### Missing Assignment Components = Lost Points
- **Pattern I'm seeing:** P2 Infographics had missing parts - people not following all steps
- Every assignment has multiple pieces:
  - Main deliverable (design, prototype, etc.)
  - Documentation (work plans, reflections)
  - Process artifacts (drafts, peer evals)
- **Documentation pads your grade** - but you can have perfect work and poor grade if you skip it
- **Before submitting:** Check myCourses rubrics for ALL required components

## III. Today's Goal: Understanding What You're Creating for Deliverable #2

**Three things due next class:**
1. **Seven User Flow Diagrams** (planning)
2. **Five+ Lo-Fi Screen Mockups** (visual wireframes)  
3. **Five Unique Tasks** (testing script)

These three pieces work together - let's break down each one.

## IV. Part 1: User Flow Diagrams (The Planning Phase)

### What is a User Flow?
A user flow maps out the journey a person takes through your app to accomplish a specific goal. It's like giving someone directions from point A to point B, but for navigating your app.

### Connection to Last Week
Remember from [10B UI/UX Design Process](10B.md#iii-uiux-design-process-overview)? User flows are **Step #1** - before you design screens, you need to understand what people are trying to do.

### Why Seven Flows?
You have three different user personas from Deliverable #1:
- **Primary user** (3 flows) - your main target audience
- **Power user** (2 flows) - someone who uses the app extensively  
- **Casual user** (2 flows) - someone who uses it occasionally

**Each persona has different goals and needs different paths through your app.** This balanced breakdown ensures you think meaningfully about all three user types without overwhelming any single persona.

### What Makes a Good User Flow Diagram?

Your user flow diagrams need four components:

1. **Title** that explains the user action
   - Example: *"Change shock intensity"*
   
2. **Entry point** where the user starts
   - Example: *"App Home Screen"*
   
3. **Series of steps** the user takes
   - Example: *"Find Settings Button" ➡️ "Navigate to Settings Screen" ➡️ "Change Intensity to Desired Level"*
   
4. **End success state** where they finish
   - Example: *"Confirm Change"*

### Visual Example
For our purposes, a simplified version like this is fine:

![screenshot](../documents/_images/user-flow-diagram.png)

### Format Options
Your flows can be:
- **Actual diagrams** (arrows, boxes, flowchart style)
- **Easy-to-read formatted text** (like the example above)

Both are acceptable - choose what works best for your team!

### Real-World Note
**In professional UX work**, user flows are often more detailed and include:
- Decision points ("if user clicks X, then show Y")
- Error states ("what happens if login fails?")
- Multiple paths ("logged in users see A, new users see B")

For this project, simplified high-level flows are fine - we're focusing on the core happy path.

## V. Part 2: Lo-Fi Screen Mockups (The Visual Phase)

<img width="700" alt="wide4wireframeexample" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07896b19-8363-4145-ad69-b30935e277f5" />

### What Are Lo-Fi Mockups?
Lo-Fi (low-fidelity) mockups are simple wireframes showing:
- **Layout:** Where things are positioned
- **Content:** What information appears
- **Basic functionality:** What's clickable

**What they're NOT:**
- ❌ Final colors, fonts, or branding
- ❌ Detailed graphics or photos
- ❌ Pixel-perfect designs

**Think:** Sketches with boxes and labels, NOT polished designs like your infographics

### Why Lo-Fi First?
It's faster to:
- Test if your layout makes sense
- Rearrange elements
- Discover missing features
- Get feedback on the core idea

**Before** investing time in making it look pretty!

### How Many Screens?
**Minimum of FIVE screens** that demonstrate your app's core functionality.

**Pro tip:** Look at your user flows - which screens appear most frequently across multiple flows? Start with those.

### Paper vs. Digital?
**Your choice!**
- **Paper mockups:** Fast to create, easy to iterate in real-time
  - Example: [Mobile Application Design : Paper Prototype Video (1:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y20E3qBmHpg)
- **Digital wireframes:** Can use Canva, Figma, Photoshop, or similar
  - Easier to share/submit
  - Can copy/paste elements

### Connection to Testing
**These screens are what you'll test next class!** Other students will:
- Look at your screens
- Try to complete tasks using your mockups
- Give you feedback on what works and what doesn't

## VI. Part 3: Testing Script with 5 Tasks (The Preparation Phase)

### What is a Testing Script?
A testing script guides you through the process of having someone test your prototype. It includes:
- Tasks for the user to attempt
- Questions to ask
- Space to record observations

### The Template
Use the [provided testing template (script)](../documents/p3-wireframe-feedback-script.md) - it's already structured for you!

### Creating Your 5 Tasks

**Step 1:** Choose 5 of your 7 user flows that you want to test

**Strategy tip:** Select tasks that cover all three personas - for example, 2-3 from primary user flows, 1-2 from power user, and 1 from casual user. This ensures you test across different user experiences.

**Step 2:** Turn each flow into a task instruction

**Example transformation:**
- **User Flow:** "Find a Quick Dinner Recipe"
- **Task for testing:** "You want to make dinner in 30 minutes or less using only 5 ingredients. Use the app to find a recipe."

**Good tasks:**
- Give context ("You want to...")
- State a goal ("...find a recipe")
- Don't give away the solution ("Click the search button")

**Bad tasks:**
- Too vague: "Use the app"
- Too specific: "Click Home, then Search, then Filter"

### Why Only 5 Tasks?
You have 7 flows total, but:
- Testing takes time
- You want feedback on your CORE features first
- You can always test more later

Choose the 5 most important flows that represent the heart of your app, making sure to test across all three personas.

## VII. See It All Together: The Complete Example

**Check out:** [P3 Deliverable #2 Example: MealMate Recipe App](../documents/p3-lofi-example.md)

This example shows you:
- What user flows look like for different personas (check the deliverable instructions for your specific requirements: 3 primary, 2 power, 2 casual)
- How to create simple lo-fi screen descriptions
- How to write 5 testing tasks

**Use this as a template** to understand the scope and format of what you're creating.

---

## VIII. Why Are We Doing All This? (The Big Picture)

### Connecting to Study Guide 11
[Study Guide 11: User Testing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f5h_8OBTGzORzFFOK5QamQqt4XgW4_Xe_ERmpZ9bmU0/edit?usp=sharing) covers why user testing matters.

**Key reasons:**
- **You are not your user** - what makes sense to you might confuse others
- **Catch problems early** - easier to fix a sketch than a finished product
- **Validate your ideas** - are you solving the right problem?
- **Discover missing features** - users will try to do things you didn't anticipate

### What Happens Next Class (11B)?
Next class you'll actually RUN the tests:
- Your team will be the "testers" using YOUR materials
- Other teams will be "users" trying to complete YOUR tasks
- You'll observe, take notes, and learn what works

**That's why you need these materials ready!**

## IX. In-Class Work Time: Create Your Deliverable #2

### Get into your teams now!

**Your goal for the rest of class:**
1. Review your Deliverable #1 (features, personas)
2. Create your 7 user flow diagrams (3 primary, 2 power, 2 casual)
3. Start designing your 5+ screen mockups
4. Begin writing your 5 testing tasks

**Use the example as your guide:** [P3 Deliverable #2 Example: MealMate Recipe App](../documents/p3-lofi-example.md)

### Questions to Ask Yourself
- Do our user flows make sense for each persona?
- Are we missing any obvious screens?
- Can someone actually test this with our 5 tasks?

### Need Help?
- Flag me down for questions
- Check the example if you're stuck
- Look at the [deliverable instructions](../documents/p3-lofi-deliverable.md) for requirements
