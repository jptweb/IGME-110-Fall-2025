# Week 2B

## I. Check-in & Housekeeping
- Quick recap: We formed groups in 2A
- Some members were absent - please connect with your groups
- **MyCourses "Overdue" Issue:**
  - Some assignments may show as "overdue" in myCourses
  - This is because I'm experimenting with "observed" assignments (like the Slack AI exercise)
  - I'll check Slack for completion and manually mark complete
  - Getting all grading caught up by Thursday
  - Investigating better ways to alert you to due dates for non-dropbox items

## II. Project 1 Recap & Documents

### Quick Overview
- Work in small groups to create a written proposal for an "app"
- Can be a phone/desktop app, website, or physical product
- Choose an SFW topic everyone agrees on

### Examples from Previous Years
- **Bike Spikes** - physical traction control for bicycles
- **BetWise** - app to help gambling addicts
- **Excuse Genie** - app for generating excuses
- **Taser Bed** - healthy electrical shocks for oversleeping
- **Anime Soap Lootboxes** - collectible physical soap figures

### Important Documents (Updated!)
- [Product Proposal Template Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kf8tE2aJdK3cHz8Lt3Q-ipGpfdDZdv2abypi8rDThsQ/) - **Updated with clarifications since 2A**
- [Product Proposal Work Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NE3mdt5ifD5SRErA-Q_-InvdCdbZwDjbSftE9HFy4bU/copy)
- [Product Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1odCPGxzw_skckC3-mhqWKHlN2Pg3lSIOXAcNRS76qWA/copy) - the actual template

### Group Communication
- Slack channels being set up for each group (technical issues - may need volunteer help)
- Alternative communication methods are fine too
- Will update once team channels are confirmed working

## III. Brainstorming Tips (Non-AI Methods)

From LinkedIn Learning: Key Brainstorming Rules

1. **Right number of people** (5-7 ideal, your groups are 3-4)
2. **Diverse perspectives** - Don't be afraid to say "stupid" things
3. **Give advance notice** - Don't spring it on people
4. **No judgment** - Leave criticism at the door
5. **Document everything** - Everyone writes down ideas
6. **Need a coach** - Someone to re-energize when stuck
7. **Capture residual ideas** - More will come after the session

### If Your Group is Stuck
- Alter the problem slightly
- Think about your own frustrations
- Look at failed products - how would you fix them?
- Consider combining two unrelated things

## IV. Deep Dive: Evaluating Sources

### The CRAAP Test
Evaluating sources for your proposal using:
- **Currency** - When was it published/updated?
- **Relevance** - Does it relate to your topic?
- **Authority** - Who's the author/publisher?
- **Accuracy** - Can you verify the information?
- **Purpose** - Why does this information exist?

### Source Types for Your Proposal
- **Academic sources** - Peer-reviewed journals
- **Industry reports** - Market analysis, trends
- **News articles** - Recent developments
- **Company data** - Case studies, white papers
- **Government statistics** - Census, labor data

### AI-Generated Sources: Special Considerations
- Always verify claims with primary sources
- Check for "hallucinated" citations
- Use AI for discovery, not as primary source
- Document your verification process

## V. Working with Citations

### Why Citations Matter in Business Proposals
- Builds credibility with investors
- Shows thorough market research
- Protects against plagiarism
- Demonstrates professionalism

### Tools We're Using
- **ZoteroBib** - Quick citation generator
- **Manual citations** - First exercise teaches the "old way" since automatic isn't always available
- **RIT Library Citation Guide** - Format references
- **Google Scholar** - I'm pretty sure theres a way to use google scholar similar to the RIT library summon search, but I may need to dig up how to unless someone knows and wishes to share (essentially using google scholar but signed into RIT so it recognizes what we have access to). I will update this document if I find good steps.

## VI. Collaboration Best Practices

### Working in Shared Google Docs
- Use "Suggesting" mode for editing others' sections
- Leave comments for questions/feedback
- Use version history if something gets deleted
- Name clearly: "Team [#] - [Product Name] Proposal"

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- Don't wait until last minute to combine sections
- Don't work in separate documents
- Don't ignore teammates' sections
- Cite sources as you go
