# Week 1A

## Welcome!
- First year students (nearly all of you)
- Game Design & Development students (most of you)
- New Media Interactive Development students (some of you - discuss!)
- Students from outside of the computing college taking this course as an elective (a few of you)

---

## I. What's the course about?
- This class is a "big picture" overview of the study of interactive media (which includes games!), ranging from social and legal aspects of media through the underlying technical aspects of various media types. You will learn research, analysis, and communication skills using a variety of media, including text, images, audio, and video.
- You will produce media artifacts both individually and in groups


## II. How is it taught?
- It is taught with a heavy "Flipped" model - meaning that the students engage in many learning activities outside of regular class time (e.g. completing assignments, watching videos, completing assignments/tutorial, participating in Slack discussions, meeting with team members, etc. Class time is then devoted to higher-order activities such as discussion, reflection, additional group work and so on
- The course centers around 4 projects, 2 of which are individual, and the other 2 are completed in small groups

## III. Let's see some projects from last semester
- Project 1 - App Proposal (group)
  - Tools used: web, academic research tools and AI for research/ideation, Google Docs for group editing and sharing, also GitHub/Markdown
- Project 2 - Infographic (solo)
  - Tools used: image editing software such as Photoshop, Canva
- Project 3 - App Prototype (different group)
  - Tools used: 
- Project 4 - Promotional Video (solo)
  - Tools used:

## IV. Syllabus
- [IGME-110 Course Syllabus (Prof. Jefferson version)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aFfF8M9hxW-ODsmttEBehSBVfbKOrLFijFr-Wc2F2aM/edit?usp=sharing)
  - BTW, GitHub markdown pages (which is what this is) don't have syntax for automatically opening a hypertext link in a new window or tab. So, if you DO want a new window or tab, you'll need to right-click ...)

## V. Notes on Academic Accommodations
- No food in the labs! Especially anything with nuts in it! Some of your fellow students have food allergies!
- Note the attendance policy!
- The late assignment policy for ***EVERYONE***, with or without academic accomodations is:
  - XXX

## VII. Stuff to do right now
- A) Discuss Offline Course Communication
  - Contacting your professor
    - always use Slack to contact me, not email
    - if you need to cc someone "in", go ahead and send an email too
  - Using Slack/email in a professional manner is an important skill if you want to be taken seriously by your professors (or future work managers)
    - "how to email your professor" (google it!)
    - https://www.maestrolabs.com/how-to/how-to-email-a-professor
- B) Intros!
