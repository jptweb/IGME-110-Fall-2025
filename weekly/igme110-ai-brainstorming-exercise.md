# AI Brainstorming Exercise: Creative Problem Solving
**IGME-110 | Week 1B | In-Class Activity**

## Objective
Learn how to use AI as a creative thinking partner to develop app/product ideas. We'll tackle real problems today to learn the process - next week you'll use these skills for Project 1!

## Choose Your Problem
Pick ONE of these to work on today:
- **Doomscrolling** - Can't stop scrolling through social media
- **Brain Rot** - Feeling mentally drained from too much screen time
- *(8am section bonus option: **8am Class Struggle** - Can't wake up for early classes)*

   - If you see your profile picture/initial → Check it's your RIT account
   - If you see "Sign in" → Click it
3. **Sign in with RIT account:**
   - Enter your FULL RIT email: `abc1234@g.rit.edu` 
   - This will redirect you to RIT's login system
   - Use your RIT computer account credentials
4. **Verify Pro Access:** You should see "Gemini Advanced" or similar indicator

## Part 1: Understanding the Problem (7 minutes)

### Step 1: Start the conversation in Guided Learning mode
Copy and paste this prompt (replace [PROBLEM] with your choice):
```
I want to design a solution for [doomscrolling / brain rot / 8am classes]. 
Help me understand this problem better by asking me questions about my experience with [PROBLEM].
```

### Step 2: Engage with Gemini's questions
- Answer honestly about YOUR experience
- Let it ask you 3-4 follow-up questions
- Notice how it's helping you think deeper about the problem
- **Save interesting insights it helps you discover**
- Note: If you aren't getting the results you want with guided learning mode you can disable it by clicking the X

## Part 2: Generating Solutions (8 minutes)

### Step 3: Brainstorm with guidance
Now prompt:
```
Based on our discussion, give me 10 creative solutions including:
- 3 practical mobile app ideas
- 3 completely ridiculous but funny ideas
- 2 physical products
- 2 social or service-based solutions

After showing me the list, help me pick the most interesting one to develop further.
```

### Step 4: Develop YOUR favorite
- Pick the idea that makes you laugh or think "that could actually work!"
- Tell Gemini which one and answer its follow-up questions
- Add your own twist or feature idea when it asks
- Give your solution a catchy name

### Step 5: Make it specific
Ask Gemini:
```
My solution is called [YOUR NAME FOR IT]. 
Help me define:
- Who EXACTLY would use this? (be specific - not just "students")
- What's the #1 feature that would make it actually helpful?
- What would make it FUN or addictive to use daily?
```

## Part 3: Visualize Your Idea (5 minutes)

### Step 6: Create a visual

Try ONE of these prompts:

**Option A - Logo:**
```
Create a logo for an app called [YOUR APP NAME] that [brief description of what it does]
```
<img width="845" height="267" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 1 42 49 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80a0eda0-07d5-4f02-8d68-e5b871793871" />

**Option B - Interface:**
```
Show me what the main screen would look like for [YOUR APP NAME]
```

**Option C - Product Design:**
```
Create a product design sketch for [YOUR PHYSICAL PRODUCT NAME]
```

### Step 7: (Optional) Try Canvas Mode
<img width="845" height="267" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 1 43 52 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd201dd2-9503-4efd-a8cd-7cc1fb176088" />

If you see a "Canvas" or code option:
```
Create a simple HTML landing page for [YOUR APP NAME] with:
- A catchy headline
- 3 feature boxes
- A fun call-to-action button
Make it colorful and playful!
```
Take a screenshot if you like the result!

## Part 4: Share Your Creation (5 minutes)

### Step 8: Post to Slack - THIS IS YOUR SUBMISSION!
1. Go to our class Slack → **#110-sec-[your section number]** channel 
   - Example: `#110-sec-08-takats-tth-8am` OR `#110-sec-02-takats-tth-2pm`
2. **Post a NEW message** in the channel with:
   - **App/Product Name:** [Your creative name]
   - **Problem Solved:** [Which problem you chose]
   - **One-liner:** [What it does in one fun sentence]
   - **Key insight:** [Something interesting Gemini helped you realize]
   - **Image:** Upload your logo/mockup (if you generated one)
   
### Step 9: Engage with others - REQUIRED!
- **You MUST reply to at least ONE classmate's post**
- **Use "Reply in thread"** to comment on someone's idea
- [SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER - Reply in Thread Button]
- Give them feedback, ask a question, or share what you like about their idea
- React with emojis to ideas you love
- Vote for "Most Practical" and "Most Ridiculous" with reactions!

## Tips for Success
✅ **Don't just take Gemini's first suggestion** - push back, ask for variations, add your own ideas

✅ **Be specific** - "tired students" → "night-owl gamers who stay up until 4am"

✅ **Have fun with it** - the sillier ideas often lead to the best insights

✅ **Save your chat** - You can share the link with others later

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: How to Submit
**You ONLY need to post in Slack (Step 8 above) by end of class today!**
- Post YOUR idea as a new message in the channel
- Reply to at least ONE classmate's post using "Reply in thread"
- No myCourses submission needed
- I'll check Slack for participation credit
- Must be posted by end of day to receive credit

## Remember
This is practice for Project 1! Next week you'll use these same techniques with your group to develop your app proposal. The goal today is to learn HOW to use AI as a creative partner, not just an answer machine.

**Questions?** Ask me or your neighbor - this is all about learning together!
