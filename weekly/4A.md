## III. Generative AI & Copyright: The Big Questions

### Question #1: Fair Use and Training Data
**Can AI companies use copyrighted materials to train their models?**

#### Case Study: NY Times vs. OpenAI/Microsoft
- [Reuters: NY Times sues OpenAI, Microsoft for infringing copyrighted works](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/ny-times-sues-openai-microsoft-infringing-copyrighted-work-2023-12-27/)
- Key facts:
  - Subscriptions generate >66% of NYT revenue
  - Ads generate ~20% of revenue
- **Discussion:** What danger does the NYT see in allowing AI access to its content?

### Question #2: AI-Generated Works and Copyright
**Can works created by AI be copyrighted? Who owns them?**

#### Current Legal Landscape
- [IP & Technology Law Society: AI, Copyright, and the Law](https://sites.usc.edu/iptls/2025/02/04/ai-copyright-and-the-law-the-ongoing-battle-over-intellectual-property-rights)
- Key questions:
  - Can AI be an author for copyright purposes?
  - Is training on copyrighted data "fair use" or infringement?
  - What about the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act of 2024?
  - Understanding the No AI FRAUD Act (2024)

### Alternative Perspectives
