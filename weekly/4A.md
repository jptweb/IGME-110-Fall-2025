## III. Generative AI & Copyright: Two Big Questions

### Question #1: Can AI companies use copyrighted materials to train their models?
- Case Study: [NY Times vs. OpenAI/Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/ny-times-sues-openai-microsoft-infringing-copyrighted-work-2023-12-27/)
- The debate: Is training AI on copyrighted data "fair use" or infringement?

### Question #2: Can AI-generated works be copyrighted?
- Current answer: Generally no - AI cannot be an "author"
- But who owns AI output? User? Company? Public domain?
- Pending legislation: Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act & No AI FRAUD Act
