# Week 9A: Prototyping Exercise

**BE Sure to goto the review the "Assignment" below in this document for what you need to turn in on Friday!!**

## Overview
Today we'll learn the fundamentals of prototyping in Figma through a guided, hands-on exercise. You'll follow along as we build a basic interactive prototype together, then enhance it on your own.

## In-Class Activity: Figma Prototyping

### Getting Started
1. Navigate to https://www.figma.com/
2. Sign in with your credentials (use "Sign in with Google" and your g.rit.edu account)
3. Follow along with the in-class demonstration

> **Note:** You don't need a Pro/Student account to complete today's exercise.

### Class Guidelines
To ensure everyone can follow along successfully:

- **Don't get ahead!** The pace may feel slow, but moving ahead will create problems in later steps
- **Raise your hand immediately if you're stuck** — falling two steps behind makes it very difficult to catch up
- **Look at the projector when instructed** — many Figma settings are hard to locate, so pay close attention during demonstrations
- **Be patient** — today's prototype will take about an hour to build, but once you understand the process, you can recreate it in just 5 minutes

### Assignment Requirements

Complete **ONE** of the following options:

#### **Option A: Enhance the Class Prototype**

1. **Add Another Interaction**
   - In class, we only made 2 of the 3 footer navigation links functional
   - Add a third page to your prototype and link it appropriately
   - Include more than just a single element on this new page
   - Show meaningful effort in the page design

2. **Increase Fidelity**
   - Transform the prototype from low-fidelity to medium or high-fidelity
   - Add brand colors, images, typography, and visual polish
   - Maintain consistency across all pages
   - This should take 10-20 minutes of thoughtful work

#### **Option B: Create Your Own Prototype**

Build an original prototype from scratch that includes:
- At least **3 interactive pages** (3 connections/interactions)
- At least **1 scrollable element**
- **Medium fidelity** design quality (more polished than a wireframe)
- Consistent visual design throughout
