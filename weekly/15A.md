## II. Welcome & Overview
- Today: Understanding your video editing options
- Thursday (15B): Work time and troubleshooting
- **Reminder:** No final exam! We will have a meeting during final exam week (likely via Zoom), in which I may incentvise showing your video to the group if you agree to show it and be present during the exam period. We will discuss this soon!

## III. The Goal of This Project

This project is about getting hands-on experience with video editing software. The skills you're building - working with timelines, making cuts, mixing audio, timing transitions - are foundational for future coursework and professional work.

**The Key Requirement:** You must assemble your video yourself in editing software. 
- AI can help generate assets (images, music, even short clips)
- But YOU do the timeline work, cuts, and assembly
- Your submission includes a screenshot of your editing timeline as proof

## IV. Video Editing Software Options

There's no single "right" tool - different software has different strengths. Here's an overview:

### Free Options

**Shotcut** (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Very powerful, professional-grade features
- Steep learning curve - some things are unintuitive
- Good for: precise editing, filters, effects
- Download: [shotcut.org](https://shotcut.org/)

**iMovie** (Mac only)
- Comes free with Mac
- Much more intuitive interface
- Good for: basic editing, adding titles, simple projects
- Limitation: Mac only, fewer advanced features

**CapCut** (Windows, Mac, Mobile)
- Very beginner-friendly
- Popular for social media content
- Good for: quick edits, text overlays, trendy effects
- **Caution:** Has AI auto-edit features - don't use these! Do your own assembly.

**Clipchamp** (Windows, Web)
- Now built into Windows 11
- Simple, browser-based option also available
- Good for: basic editing if you're on Windows without other options

**DaVinci Resolve** (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Professional Hollywood-grade software (free version available)
- Overkill for this project, but if you want to learn industry tools...
- Steep learning curve

### Paid Options

**Adobe Premiere Pro**
- Industry standard for professional video
- Available on RIT lab computers (free for you there)
- **Personal license warning:** Adobe offers a student deal (~$20/month) BUT read the fine print. It's an "annual paid monthly" plan - if you cancel mid-year, you owe 50% of remaining payments. The FTC is currently suing Adobe over these deceptive practices.

**Final Cut Pro** (Mac only)
- $299 one-time purchase
- Professional Mac alternative to Premiere

## V. What Real Users Say

Here's what actual users say about these tools ([source: r/software discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1l23jsk/best_video_editing_software/)):

**On DaVinci Resolve:**
> "Davinci and Premiere are not easy to work with"

> "I don't agree with all these other posters that Davinci is 'fairly easy for beginners'. Shotcut is a better one to get started with."

> "Davinci has a lot of features that you can just ignore if they're beyond your needs, or until you feel like experimenting."

**On Shotcut:**
> "Pretty beginner friendly imo. I had zero video editing knowledge when I downloaded it. Just wanted a 15 min beginner tutorial and that was it."

**On Clipchamp:**
> "Clipchamp stores projects in the cloud only. That is an immediate no for me."

**On CapCut (from other sources):**
> "I picked it up in literally 10 minutes... but a big downside is its inability to do multi-track editing efficiently."

**The takeaway:** There's no perfect tool. Many users recommend downloading both Shotcut and DaVinci Resolve, playing with both, and seeing which fits your workflow better.

## VI. Quick Comparison

### A Note on "Tiers"

Not all editing software is created equal. Roughly speaking:

**Consumer-level tools** (iMovie, Clipchamp, CapCut): Easy to learn, but videos often have that "made with iMovie" look. Limited control. Fine for getting something done quickly, but you won't learn skills that transfer to professional work.

**Professional-level tools** (Shotcut, DaVinci Resolve, Kdenlive, Premiere): Steeper learning curve, but the skills transfer to industry work. More control, more flexibility. Worth the investment if you have time.

*What about Windows Movie Maker?* It was comparable to iMovie back in the day, but Microsoft discontinued it in 2017. Clipchamp is the official replacement. If you find old download links for Movie Maker online, be cautious—many are bundled with malware.

**My recommendation:** Push yourself toward the professional tier if you can—you'll get more out of it. But if you're truly stuck and just need to submit something, consumer tools will work.

### Comparison Table

| Tool | Level | Best For | Strengths | Watch Out For |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **CapCut** | Consumer | Quick assembly, social media style | Very easy, auto-captions, trendy effects | Multi-track sync issues; has AI auto-edit (don't use it!) |
| **iMovie** | Consumer | Simple Mac projects | Very intuitive, comes free with Mac | Mac only, limited features, "iMovie look" |
| **Clipchamp** | Consumer | Quick Windows editing | Built into Windows 11, replaced Movie Maker | Cloud-only storage, limited features |
| **Shotcut** | Professional | Trimming clips, applying filters | Free, cross-platform, powerful filters | Unintuitive interface, text overlay is weird |
| **DaVinci Resolve** | Professional | Color correction, multi-track editing | Industry-standard, free version is excellent | Overwhelming at first—stick to Edit page only |
| **Kdenlive** | Professional | Open-source alternative | Feature-rich, not a resource hog | Can be buggy, interface takes getting used to |

## VII. The "Mix and Match" Approach

Here's a workflow that might work well, especially if one tool feels overwhelming:

**Use Shotcut or DaVinci for:**
- Trimming individual clips (cut out the parts you don't need)
- Applying filters to specific clips (color correction, effects)
- Precise adjustments

**Export those clips, then use simpler software for:**
- Final assembly on a timeline
- Adding title cards and text overlays
- Basic transitions between clips
- Adding music/audio track

For example:
1. You have a 50-second screen recording
2. Open it in Shotcut, trim it to 30 seconds, apply a filter
3. Export that trimmed clip
4. Import the clip into iMovie/CapCut/Clipchamp
5. Add your title card, other clips, and music there
6. Export final video

This way you learn multiple tools and use each for what it does best.

## VIII. Shotcut Quick Demo

### ⚠️ WATCH THE TUTORIAL FIRST

**Seriously.** Shotcut is powerful but unintuitive. I have video editing experience and still found it nearly impossible to figure out until I watched this tutorial:

**[Shotcut Tutorial for Beginners (30 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCMcyYAtRzw)**

Yes, it's 30 minutes. But it will save you HOURS of frustration. Watch it before you start, not after you're already stuck.

### Getting Oriented
- **Playlist Panel:** Where your source clips live
- **Timeline:** Where you arrange clips (this is what your screenshot should show!)
- **Preview Window:** Shows what you're building
- **Filters Panel:** Where effects and text live

### Basic Workflow
1. **Import clips:** Open File menu or drag files into Playlist
2. **Add to timeline:** Drag from Playlist to Timeline
3. **Trim clips:** Drag edges of clips on timeline, or use split tool (S key)
4. **Add another track:** Right-click on track header → Add Video Track
5. **Export:** Export menu → choose format (MP4 recommended)

### Adding Text (The Unintuitive Part)
This is where Shotcut trips people up:
1. Go to **Open Other** → **Text** (creates a text clip)
2. Or: Select a clip → **Filters** → **+** → **Text: Simple** or **Text: Rich**
3. Adjust duration, position, font in the filter panel

### Quick Tips
- Save your project often (File → Save)
- Keyboard shortcuts speed things up (S = split, I/O = set in/out points)
- If something breaks, Ctrl+Z (undo) is your friend
- YouTube tutorials for specific tasks: search "Shotcut [what you want to do]"
