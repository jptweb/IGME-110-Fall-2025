## II. Introduction to User Experience (UX) & Interaction Design

> I showed a slideshow today with the same information as below, but with some visual elements. You don't need to study this was more to connect the dots and look too the future but here it is for reference: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13xpDuO9XmoS9RJmCUr37Ir8j7uPLeXhY/

### Why This Matters Now
You've actually been doing UX work all semester without realizing it:
- **P1 (App Proposal):** You identified user problems and defined target audiences
- **P2 (Infographic):** You designed information to be understood by specific users
- **P3 (Prototype - next week):** You'll design HOW users actually interact with your app

### Common Design Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Designing for yourself instead of your users

❌ Assuming everyone thinks like you

❌ Adding features YOU want instead of what users need

Your job: Design for someone else's needs, test if it works for them, remove your own bias

### Tools UX Designers Use
We'll explore these more in P3, but here's what they are:

**Personas** - Detailed profiles of who your users are
- Example: Not just "college students" but "20-year-old commuter student who works part-time and struggles with time management"

**Sitemaps** - Show how information/pages are organized
- Like a family tree for your app or website
- Helps you see if navigation makes sense

**Wireframes** - Low-fidelity sketches showing layout and structure
- Focus on "where things go" not "how things look"
- Often just boxes and lines - no color, no final fonts

**Mockups** - High-fidelity visual designs
- This is what your infographics are - mockups!
- Shows actual colors, fonts, images

**Prototypes** 
THIS IS NEXT WEEKS TOPIC!
- Clickable/interactive versions you can test
- Users can click through and try to complete tasks
- Helps you find problems BEFORE you build the real thing

**Remember:** It can always be better! Professional designers go through many rounds of feedback and revision.

## III. Creating Cohesive Charts & Graphics

### The Problem
Many of your infographic drafts have charts that look like they came from different sources:
- Some charts are pixelated screenshots
- Different visual styles that don't match
- Colors that don't align with your palette
- Inconsistent fonts

**Why this matters:** Visual inconsistency makes your infographic look unprofessional and distracts from your message.

### The Solution: Create Your Own Charts

**Option 1: Canva Charts**
- Free charts built right into Canva
- Check this out too: https://www.canva.com/graphs/
- Bar charts, donut/pie charts, line graphs, and more
- Can match your exact color palette
- Can customize fonts to match your typography
- **Pro tip:** Use Canva's "Brand Kit" feature to save your infographic colors

**Steps in Canva:**
1. Click "Elements" in the left sidebar
2. Search for "chart" or browse chart types
3. Click to add to your canvas
4. Edit data by clicking on the chart
5. Customize colors, fonts, labels
6. Resize and position as needed

**Option 2: PowerPoint/Google Slides Charts**
- Create charts with your data
- Customize all colors and fonts
- Export as high-resolution image
- Right-click chart → Save as Picture

> NOTE: like many tools out there some of these you will need to explore on your own. Feel free to watch videos and find resources on the web to help
you create charts and assets for your infographic; though as always if you hit the wall feel free to ask me. Just don't start this an hour before its due
though and expect to get very much help from me.
**Key principle:** ALL data visualizations in your infographic should share the same design language (colors, fonts, styles)

## IV. Peer Feedback Session

### How This Works

**Get in groups of 2-3. Pull up your infographics. Talk about them.**

### What to talk about:

- What works well?

- What's confusing?

- Any obvious mistakes? (spelling, readability, etc.)

- Think about CRAP:

  - Contrast - Can you read everything?

  - Repetition - Do things look consistent?

  - Alignment - Does it look organized?

  - Proximity - Are related things grouped together?

- Would this resonate with/persuade the target audience?

## V. Tonight's Required Reflection (Due 11:59 PM)

### What to Submit to myCourses
Write a brief reflection (150-200 words) addressing these 5 questions:

**1. Collaboration:**  
Who did you work with today? (List 2-3 names)

**2. Feedback Received:**  
What key feedback did you receive on your infographic? (Briefly summarize in 2-3 sentences)

**3. Action Plan:**  
What is ONE specific change you plan to make to your infographic based on feedback?

**4. Learning from Others:**  
What is ONE good idea or approach you saw in someone else's work that inspired you or that you might incorporate?

**5. Forward Thinking:**  
Next week we start P3 (Prototypes). If your infographic content became an interactive app, what would users expect to be able to click on or interact with? (1-2 sentences)

### Submission Details
- Submit to: "Infographic - Informal Peer Feedback Reflection" dropbox in myCourses
- Due: Tonight by 11:59 PM
- Format: Can submit as text directly in dropbox, or upload Word doc/PDF - whatever's easiest
  **EASY POINTS! Don't need perfection here just submit!** This can greatly help your overall score if you missed an earlier assignment!

### If You Were Absent Today
You must still do these things! If you are sick and in bed with Flu we can discuss a brief extension but the onus is on you to reach out ASAP if this was an excused absense.
OTHERWISE; if you werent here and want credit what I suggest is to IMMEDIATLY:
- Reach out to 1-2 classmates via Slack (maybe your teammates?)
- Ask if they are willing to do a review your Proposal; and virtually exchange feedback via slack or other communication method (Zoom?)

**This reflection is your proof of participation for today's class.**

## VI. Before Next Class (Week 9A - Tuesday Oct 21)

### Two Important Deadlines:

**1. P2 Infographic - Final Version** (exact due date in mycourses)
- Address all feedback from today
- Recreate any mismatched charts using Canva or PowerPoint
- Ensure visual consistency throughout

- Update your documentation with sources
- See full requirements: [P2 Final Requirements](../documents/p2-final.md)

**2. Week 9 Study Guide: Introduction to Figma & Interaction Design** (see mycourses for due date)

- Complete the "Hello Figma" introductory tutorial
- This is non-negotiable - we'll be using Figma immediately in Week 9A
- See: [Week 9 Study Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nlwsaJXJozfZu4VocByOHxetIghnsTwGtABZgRNFOCc/edit?usp=sharing)

### What's Coming in Week 9
