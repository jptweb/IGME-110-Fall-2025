## III. Rewind/Deep Dive: Evaluating Sources (week 2 topic)

### The CRAAP Test
Evaluating sources for your proposal using:
- **Currency** - When was it published/updated?
- **Relevance** - Does it relate to your topic?
- **Authority** - Who's the author/publisher?
- **Accuracy** - Can you verify the information?
- **Purpose** - Why does this information exist?

### Source Types for Your Proposal
- **Academic sources** - Peer-reviewed journals
- **Industry reports** - Market analysis, trends
- **News articles** - Recent developments
- **Company data** - Case studies, white papers
- **Government statistics** - Census, labor data

### AI-Generated Sources: Special Considerations
- Always verify claims with primary sources
- Check for "hallucinated" citations
- Use AI for discovery, not as primary source
- Document your verification process

- Use version history if something gets deleted
- Name clearly: "Team [#] - [Product Name] Proposal"
