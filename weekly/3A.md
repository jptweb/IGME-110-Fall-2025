## III. Rewind/Deep Dive: Evaluating Sources (week 2 topic)

### The CRAAP Test
Evaluating sources for your proposal using:
- **Currency** - When was it published/updated?
- **Relevance** - Does it relate to your topic?
- **Authority** - Who's the author/publisher?
- **Accuracy** - Can you verify the information?
- **Purpose** - Why does this information exist? Who has published it? (or paid for it?)

### Source Types for Your Proposal
- **Academic sources** - Peer-reviewed journals
- **Industry reports** - Market analysis, trends
- **News articles** - Recent developments
- **Company data** - Case studies, white papers
- **Government statistics** - Census, labor data

### AI-Generated Sources: Special Considerations
- Always verify claims with primary sources
- Check for "hallucinated" citations
- Use AI for discovery, not as primary source
- Document your verification process

## V. Collaboration Best Practices

### Communication
- Can't make it to class, or going to miss a deliverable? ***LET YOUR TEAM KNOW ASAP!***

### Working in Shared Google Docs
- Use "Suggesting" mode for editing others' sections
- Leave comments for questions/feedback
- Use version history if something gets deleted
- Name clearly: "Team [#] - [Product Name] Proposal"

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- Don't wait until last minute to combine sections
- Don't work in separate documents
- Don't ignore teammates' sections
- Cite sources as you go

## VI. Project 1 - Product Proposal

### Firstly, P1 Work Plans
- all done! [P1 Teams](../documents/p1-teams.md)

### Secondly - some tips on App Def Statements & App Features!
- ["App Discussion"](../documents/app-discussion-1.md)

### Thirdly, P1 Product Proposal - DRAFT
- ***Due before our next class meeting!*** See Assignments tab in mycourses for due date/time. Required elements are below. Here's the rubric for the FINAL version (50 points, due 2nd class, week 4):
  1. **Executive Summary**
      - The Summary/Conclusion Writer will provide  a high-level overview of the application. This section should answer the following:
        - Give us a "high concept" product statement: Meaning … *What is the application’s NAME?* *What does it DO?*
        - And … Who is the target audience? WHO is it for?
        - Example: *LevelUpLife - a social rewards service that helps college students stop Doomscrolling*
        - What key problem does it solve?
        - What are its unique features or benefits?
  2. **Market Research and Need Analysis**
      - The Market Researcher will present the research that supports the need for the application. This section should include:
        - Gaps, unmet needs or even social ills that your application addresses
        - An analysis of existing solutions in the market (competitor analysis)
          - you may wish to have subheadings for 2 or 3 major competitors, where you detail their strengths and weakness and highlights from their reviews. Be sure to provide screenshots of these competitor apps
        - Any statistical data or qualitative evidence supporting the demand for such an application (survey results, industry reports, etc.)
          - if you made any statements above such as *"doomscrolling is a pervasive problem among high school and college students"* - you need to cite specific sources that support your claim
     - Other requirements:
       - Provide charts and graphs that help to visually communicate relevant research to the reader
  3. **Product Description**
      - The Product Designer will provide a detailed description of the application's features and how it works. This should include:
        - A list of core features, with brief explanations of each
        - How the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are designed to meet the needs of the target audience
        - Any technological innovations or creative ideas that set the application apart from others
  4. **Possible Issues and Counterarguments**
      - The Devil’s Advocate/Critic will identify potential criticisms or challenges to the proposal. Address the following:
        - Possible objections to the need for the product (e.g., "Is this already solved by existing apps?")
        - Technical or financial challenges that could arise during development
        - How your group plans to overcome these challenges or justify the product's relevance despite challenges
  6. **Conclusion and Recommendations**
      - The Summary/Conclusion Writer will summarize the main points of the proposal and reiterate why the application is needed. This section should leave a lasting impression and include:
        - A brief recap of the problem and solution
        - The potential impact of the application (social, financial, or user benefits)
        - A clear call to action (e.g., "We recommend moving forward with the development of this app because…")
  7. **Appendix**
      - at least 5 citations (MLA or similar - https://zbib.org/ makes it easy)
      - Additional data, charts, or research materials will be included here to support the proposal

### Fourthly, So what needs to be completed for the DRAFT?
  - You should be making SUBSTANTIAL progress in each of the 6 categories
  - How much is enough? There should be plenty for the other groups to critique and give feedback on when we meet 3B
  - For the draft use this [proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1khRFXrBf5BCrPiw7z9wpl2QXw2PDqvH8JMCC1MXbbSA/edit?usp=sharing), and follow these [proposal template instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AX62N88jqIE92HUXSzVwGizRtOTt2CcmOuSqwnApOEY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - PS - the DRAFT that you post to the myCourses dropbox the night before class is what we are grading
