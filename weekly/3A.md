## II. Deep Dive: Evaluating Sources

### The CRAAP Test
Evaluating sources for your proposal using:
- **Currency** - When was it published/updated?
- **Relevance** - Does it relate to your topic?
- **Authority** - Who's the author/publisher?
- **Accuracy** - Can you verify the information?
- **Purpose** - Why does this information exist?

### Source Types for Your Proposal
- **Academic sources** - Peer-reviewed journals
- **Industry reports** - Market analysis, trends
- **News articles** - Recent developments
- **Company data** - Case studies, white papers
- **Government statistics** - Census, labor data

### AI-Generated Sources: Special Considerations
- Always verify claims with primary sources
- Check for "hallucinated" citations
- Use AI for discovery, not as primary source
- Document your verification process

## IV. Working with Citations

### Why Citations Matter in Business Proposals
- Builds credibility with investors
- Shows thorough market research
- Protects against plagiarism
- Demonstrates professionalism

### Tools We're Using
- **ZoteroBib** - Quick citation generator
- **Manual citations** - First exercise teaches the "old way" since automatic isn't always available
- **RIT Library Citation Guide** - Format references
- **Google Scholar** - I'm pretty sure theres a way to use google scholar similar to the RIT library summon search, but I may need to dig up how to unless someone knows and wishes to share (essentially using google scholar but signed into RIT so it recognizes what we have access to). I will update this document if I find good steps. FOUND STEPS: https://infoguides.rit.edu/googlescholar

## V. Collaboration Best Practices

### Communication
- Can't make it to class, or going to miss a deliverable? ***LET YOUR TEAM KNOW ASAP!***

### Working in Shared Google Docs
- Use "Suggesting" mode for editing others' sections
- Leave comments for questions/feedback
- Use version history if something gets deleted
- Name clearly: "Team [#] - [Product Name] Proposal"

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- Don't wait until last minute to combine sections
- Don't work in separate documents
- Don't ignore teammates' sections
- Cite sources as you go
