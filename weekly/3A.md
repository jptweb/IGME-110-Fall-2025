### Thirdly, P1 Product Proposal - DRAFT
- ***Due before our next class meeting!*** See Assignments tab in mycourses for due date/time. Required elements are below. Here's the rubric for the FINAL version (50 points, due 2nd class, week 4):
  1. **Executive Summary**
      - The Summary/Conclusion Writer will provide  a high-level overview of the application. This section should answer the following:
        - Give us a "high concept" product statement: Meaning … *What is the application’s NAME?* *What does it DO?*
        - And … Who is the target audience? WHO is it for?
        - Example: *LevelUpLife - a social rewards service that helps college students stop Doomscrolling*
        - What key problem does it solve?
        - What are its unique features or benefits?
  2. **Market Research and Need Analysis**
      - The Market Researcher will present the research that supports the need for the application. This section should include:
        - Gaps, unmet needs or even social ills that your application addresses
        - An analysis of existing solutions in the market (competitor analysis)
        - Any statistical data or qualitative evidence supporting the demand for such an application (survey results, industry reports, etc.)
     - Other requirements:
       - Provide charts and graphs that help to visually communicate relevant research to the reader
       - Provide  screenshots of competitor apps 
  3. **Product Description**
      - The Product Designer will provide a detailed description of the application's features and how it works. This should include:
        - A list of core features, with brief explanations of each
        - How the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are designed to meet the needs of the target audience
        - Any technological innovations or creative ideas that set the application apart from others
  4. **Possible Issues and Counterarguments**
      - The Devil’s Advocate/Critic will identify potential criticisms or challenges to the proposal. Address the following:
        - Possible objections to the need for the product (e.g., "Is this already solved by existing apps?")
        - Technical or financial challenges that could arise during development
        - How your group plans to overcome these challenges or justify the product's relevance despite challenges
  6. **Conclusion and Recommendations**
      - The Summary/Conclusion Writer will summarize the main points of the proposal and reiterate why the application is needed. This section should leave a lasting impression and include:
        - A brief recap of the problem and solution
        - The potential impact of the application (social, financial, or user benefits)
        - A clear call to action (e.g., "We recommend moving forward with the development of this app because…")
  7. **Appendix**
      - at least 5 citations (MLA or similar - https://zbib.org/ makes it easy)
      - Additional data, charts, or research materials will be included here to support the proposal

### Fourthly, So what needs to be completed for the DRAFT?
  - You should be making SUBSTANTIAL progress in each of the 7 categories
  - How much is enough? There should be plenty for the other groups to critique and give feedback on when we meet 3B
  - PS - we are grading the DRAFT that you post dropbox the night before class
