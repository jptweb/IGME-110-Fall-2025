## I. Last Week's Assignments

- ***Getting Started: Using Our Slack Workspace***
  - You should have already posted an introduction!
  - Can anyone NOT get into the section specific Slack channel?
- ***Generative AI Exercises***
  - We used these for brainstorming potential app ideas and features
  - [AI Brainstorming Exercise with Gemini - Doomscrolling](../exercises/ai-brainstorming-2151.md)
- ***[Week 2 Study Guide: Finding & Evaluating Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wDECfUJ0vOIfQwDLwyfGh6lNDSAkpz16XXAOAUGdJ1A)***
  - i) Properly citing sources
    - and the good news is ..?
  - ii) YouTube - ***Fact Checking: Crash Course Navigating Digital Information #2*** - deciding what's credible
    - Go beyond focusing on the professional presentation of the site, and instead focus on these 3 questions:
    - 1) *Who is behind this information, and what is their motivation for sharing it?*
    - 2) *What is the claim itself? What is the evidence for their claims? What is the source of this evidence?*
    - 3) *What do other sources say about the organization and its claims? Check multiple sources.*
    - ***Have discussions with real data and real cost-benefit analyses**
    -  **Better information leads to better decisions**
    -  **Try to be skeptical, not cynical**
        - --> https://www.racket.news/p/how-the-opiate-conspiracy-widened
    -  **Make a habit of fact checking information that we find interesting or sharable or that makes us emotional**
    -  **We have to train our internal falsehood alarms to respond not just to potential misinformation we disaagree with, but also information we agree with. Test your assumptions sometimes.***
  - iii) RIT Library InforGuide for Interactive Games and Media: https://infoguides.rit.edu/game-design
    - Do some searches/look under the menus:
      - "Design of Everyday Things"
      - O'Reilly Media & LinkedIn Learning
      - mintel market research
      - GDC proceedings
      - Internet Arcade

## II. Generative AI Tools in the Workplace - A Discussion

### The Reality of AI in Industry
- AI is already integrated into professional workflows
- Learning ethical use vs. avoiding entirely
- Your future colleagues will have varying comfort levels with AI

### Addressing Valid Concerns
- Environmental impact considerations
- Intellectual property and attribution
- AI as a tool, not a replacement for creativity

### Finding Your Balance
- This course teaches foundational skills (design, prototyping, communication)
- AI is one tool among many - not required for core learning
- Groups will have mixed preferences - just like real workplaces
- Respecting different approaches while collaborating effectively

## IV. Brainstorming Tips

- From [LinkedIn Learning: Brainstorming](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-brainstorming/defining-the-purpose-of-brainstorming-14168757)
  - Rule 1: Have the right number of brainstormers (5 to 7)
  - Rule 2: Don't fill the room with the same person:
    - fill it out with people who feel differently than you
    - don't be afraid to say stupid things
  - Rule 3: No pop quizzes
    - don't spring brainstorming on people! Give them opt out option and 2 day notice
    - give people time to consciously or subconsciously solve it. Adults are serial problem solvers
    - we start solving problems subconsciously the moment we are presented with them. Give people the problem ahead of time
  - Rule 9: Leave the judge at the door
    - eliminate idea criticism from the session
  - Rule 10: Document the Brainstorming Process
    - make it everyone's responsibility - write down your idea
  - Rule 11: Every team needs a coach
    - energy declines! We all stare blankly at each other
    - alter the problem in some way
  - Rule 12: Capture Residual Ideas
    - more ideas will come later
