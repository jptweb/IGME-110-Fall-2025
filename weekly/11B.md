# Week 11B - Testing Your LoFi Prototypes

---

## I. Overview

Today we're conducting qualitative usability testing on your LoFi prototypes. Catching issues now, when they're easy to fix, is far better than discovering them after you've built everything in high fidelity.

**Important mindset:** If you discover that users struggle with your prototype, that's actually a **WIN**. Finding problems now means you can fix them before investing time in detailed implementation. Even if you have to completely rethink your design, you're learning what your users actually need.

## II. Testing Methodology & The Roles

**How it works:**

### Giving the test
- The **Facilitator** reads tasks to the user and asks follow-up questions (but doesn't hint at solutions)
- The **Computer** physically changes the mockups based on what the user indicates they would click/tap
- The **Scribe** captures everything: observations, quotes, hesitations, and suggestions

### Taking the test
- The **User** "thinks aloud" while trying to accomplish tasks

**Extra team members:** Support one of these roles or help organize materials.

## III. Today's Schedule

### Phase 1: Team Preparation (15 minutes)
**Get your testing setup ready:**
1. **Prepare your mockups:**
   - **Paper mockups** work great for testing (hand-drawn or printed)
   - **Digital mockups** can be displayed on a laptop screen - have them ready to show one screen at a time
   - If you submitted digital mockups 30+ minutes before the deadline, I may have printed them for you
   - **Section 8:** I can do emergency printing during prep (printer is close)
   - **Section 2:** Please come prepared - I can't run to the printer during class
   - Scissors available if you need to cut up drawings so users see one screen at a time
2. Assign roles: Who will be Facilitator, Computer, and Scribe?
3. Organize materials:
   - Physical mockups: Arrange in logical order for quick access
   - Digital mockups: Have files open and ready, know how to navigate between screens
   - Testing script: Ready to use
4. Create a shared document for results (Google Doc recommended)
5. Set up your testing "station":
   - Get paper from the back table
   - Write your **Team Number** and **Project Name** in large letters
   - Place sign where other teams can easily find you

### Phase 2: Team Pairing & Testing (30-35 minutes)
1. **Find your paired team** (see matchmaking below)
2. **First 15-minute session:** Team A tests with Team B members as users
   - **Reality check:** Team A needs 3 people to facilitate (Facilitator, Computer, Scribe), which means Team B might only have 1 person available to be a user at a time. That's okay! Focus on getting quality feedback from whoever can test.
3. **5-minute debrief:** Both teams discuss Team A's prototype - what worked, what was confusing
4. **Switch roles for 15 minutes:** Team B tests with Team A members as users
5. **5-minute debrief:** Both teams discuss Team B's prototype

**Goal:** Get quality feedback from 2-3 users. Quality over quantity! If you can only get 1 user during class, that's still valuable - recruit additional testers after class.

### Phase 3: Wrap-up (5 minutes)
- Return to your team workspace
- Begin organizing your findings
- Identify immediate improvements you can make

### Section 02 (TTh 2:00-3:15PM)

**Pairing 1:** **Team 1** (Campus Compass) ↔ **Team 2** (RaiseRunner)

**Pairing 2:** **Team 3** (Aperture Labs - Portal alarm) ↔ **Team 4** (EXP Quest)

**Pairing 3:** **Team 5** (Wize Wizard) ↔ **Team 6** (Aperture Labs - Motivation app)

**Pairing 4:** **Team 7** (Wize Wizard) ↔ **Team 8** (Better RIT)

**Pairing 5:** **Team 9** (Campus Compass) ↔ **Team 10** (Better RIT)

## V. After Class: Complete Your Deliverable

### Required Materials (ONE submission per team to myCourses)

**1. Two (2) Completed Testing Scripts** *(More is better, but minimum of 2)*
- One script per user who tested your app
- Use the template: [P3 Wireframe Feedback Script](../documents/p3-wireframe-feedback-script.md)
- If you couldn't get 2 users during class, recruit additional testers outside of class
- Clearly indicate which testers were from class vs. recruited afterward

**If testing didn't go well:** If you had major technical issues or couldn't get enough users during class, you have two options:
- **Option A:** Recruit 2-3 users outside of class and conduct proper testing
- **Option B:** Write a 1-page reflection explaining what went wrong, what you learned, and how you'll conduct testing moving forward (then still recruit at least 1 user to test)

**2. Summary Document**

Include these sections:

**A. Debrief Results** - Feedback from the team debrief and patterns across users

**B. Obvious Improvements** - Changes you can make to improve user experience (prioritize by impact)

**C. Missing Features** - Features users expected but aren't in your prototype

**D. Implementation Plan** - Which features will you implement in your HiFi prototype for next week?

**Due Date:** See myCourses for submission deadline

## VI. Important Reminders

**This is a learning framework:** We're teaching you a structured approach to usability testing. It might not be perfect today, but understanding the process means you could repeat it on your own. **If everyone leaves today understanding what we were trying to accomplish and feels confident they could conduct proper usability testing with more time, that's a success.**

**Finding problems = winning:** Every issue discovered now saves time later. Even scrapping your whole design and starting fresh is a massive win at this stage.

**Paper prototypes work:** Some of the best apps in the world started as sketches. Lo-fi formats force you to focus on functionality over polish.

---

## VII. Looking Ahead

**Week 12A:** Begin implementing your HiFi prototype in Figma/PowerPoint with consistent design elements (colors, fonts, icons). **Start before class!**

**Week 12B:** Test your HiFi prototype - draft due before class

**Week 13A:** Present completed HiFi prototype to class
