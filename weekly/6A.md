## I. Quick Study Guide Recap (10 minutes)

### From Your LinkedIn Learning Course
**The Big 6 Design Principles:**
1. **Visual Hierarchy** - Size, color, placement guide the eye
2. **Balance** - Symmetrical vs. asymmetrical layouts
3. **Contrast** - Making important things pop
4. **Repetition** - Consistency across design
5. **Alignment** - Clean, organized appearance
6. **Proximity** - Group related elements

### Typography Essentials
- **Pair wisely:** Contrast fonts (serif + sans-serif)
- **Less is more:** 2-3 fonts maximum
- **Think hierarchy:** Headers â†’ Subheaders â†’ Body text

### Color Palettes
- **60-30-10 Rule:** Dominant color (60%), secondary (30%), accent (10%)
- **Test for accessibility:** Ensure readable contrast
