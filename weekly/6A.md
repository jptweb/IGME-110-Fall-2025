# Week 6A

## I. *The Medium is the message*

- *"The medium is the message" is a phrase coined by the Canadian communication theorist Marshall McLuhan and the name of the first chapter in his [Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man](https://mcluhan.org/understanding-media/), published in 1964. McLuhan proposes that a communication medium itself, not the messages it carries, should be the primary focus of study.*

### Discussion Questions

- *Do you think McLuhan would consider movies and television to be a comparable medium to online videos? Why or why not?* (from Study Guide)
  - first, books/newspapers -> radio -> television - how are these media distinct?
  - let's consider the characteristics of movies/tv to YouTube videos: how are they distributed? where do we consume them? are the communal or non-communal? created by professionals or anyone? how does the end user "participate"?
- TicTok/YouTube Shorts? Streaming? Podcasts?
