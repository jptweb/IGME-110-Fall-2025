# Week 4B 

---

## I. P1 - Product Proposal - Due Soon!
### I-A. Round up of P1 requirements
- [documents/p1-overview.md](../documents/p1-overview.md)
- [documents/p1-rubric-draft.md](../documents/p1-rubric-draft.md)
- [documents/p1-rubric-final.md](../documents/p1-rubric-final.md)

### I-B.  Overall writing advice
- Formatting and structure - headings, subheadings, bulleted and ordered lists make the content easier to read and understand
- Long blocks of unbroken text is hard to read
- Craft the proper tone - you are attempting to persuade a professional audience. Do not be too jokey or flippant. Minimal or no slang, no expletives.
- Do not use interjections - https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-an-interjection-1691178
- Less can often be more. Eliminate redundancy - https://edubirdie.com/blog/redundancy-in-writing

### I-C. "Section" advice

- Overall: Once again, see [documents/p1-rubric-final.md](../documents/p1-rubric-final.md)
- I. **Executive Summary**
  - A focused list of features, rather than a "kitchen sink" app, is easier to describe (and possibly implement in project 3)
  - Just give an overview of the app -  specifics belong in section III.
- II. **Market Research**
  - When you make a claim here, be sure to back it up with evidence (cite some sources!)
- III. **Product Description**
  - Good organization and layout is key: once again: subheadings/subsections, lists, captioned images
- IV. **Possible Issues and Counterarguments**
  - After you raise any possible issues, be sure to counter them. If you can't credibly counter them, maybe your project features need work.
- V. **Conclusions & Recommendations**
  - For tips on making the conclusion compelling; not just a rehash of the intro/summary see --> https://www.brandeis.edu/writing-program/resources/students/academic/drafting-revision/conclusions-avoiding-repetition.html
