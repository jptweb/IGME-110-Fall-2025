## II. Looking Ahead: Upcoming Assignments

### Finding and Evaluating Exercises from weeks ago
  - This is that old set of two assignments I kept putting this off, and put the due date off in the distance which is NOW finally upon us. I was hoping to see more people had done it but only see a few have handed it in and now things may be compounding... but I cannot put off the due date any longer
  - This is due end of the week!
