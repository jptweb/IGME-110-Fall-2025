# Week 12B Notes - Progress Check & Figma Polish

## I. Quick Reminders

**Due Tuesday (13A - Nov 18):**
- Final prototype + presentation slides
- ~5 minutes per team
- All team members must speak

**Full instructions:** [P3 - Deliverables #3A & #3B: Final Prototype & Presentation](../documents/p3-hifi-deliverable.md)

---

## II. Progress Check via Slack

**Please share on Slack today**
- Screenshot or link to your current prototype
- Shows accountability and progress

**I'm looking for:**
- At least 2-3 screens built
- Basic navigation working
- Consistent design (colors, fonts)

---

## III. Optional Figma Polish: Variables & Toggle Buttons

### The Big Question: How Polished Should Your Prototype Be?

**Remember:** You're building a **prototype**, not a working app!

**Think back to your lo-fi testing:**
- Users were "thinking aloud" while you showed screens
- You could swap screens manually
- Form fields didn't need to actually work
- That was OK - it's a prototype!

**The same applies to hi-fi:**
- Stakeholders viewing your prototype understand it's not a real app
- You draw the line somewhere - perfect is the enemy of done
- A prototype that looks very close to the real thing can really sell the concept
- BUT if it takes weeks/months to build, it defeats the purpose

**Prototypes are meant to be built BEFORE the app, not become the app.**

### Figma Variables & Toggle Buttons (Optional Advanced Techniques)

If you want to add extra polish and have time, here are some techniques:

**Variables in Figma:**
- Create reusable values (colors, spacing, etc.)
- Change them once, update everywhere
- Useful for consistent design systems
- [Intro to Variables Video By Figma Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ONxxlJnvdM) (a bit overkill for what we need but I couldnt find much briefer one)

**Toggle Buttons (Interactive Components):**
- Basic toggle tutorial: [Building a Toggle Button (5:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArJS_5h_KVM)
- Advanced example with light/dark mode: [Advanced Toggle (12:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DayAH0OrRuI)
  - Note: Figma UI has changed slightly, so parts of this video may not match exactly
- **[FIGMA Demo of Toggle and light/dark mode](https://www.figma.com/design/0ozlAyDq0Vu0oeu4yuEZGC/Light-Mode-And-Variable-Demo?node-id=0-1&t=aWdfQ7uXrEVXnAhQ-1)** Here is a simple demo I made of light/dark mode and a toggle button. It is public so anyone can see; so reverse engineer it you may want to make a "COPY" of it so you can edit and see all the innerworkings. I built this with knowledge from the Basic Toggle Tutorial and Advanced Example in the first two bullets above.

  
**Figma Advanced Prototyping with Variables** - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEuwKJAz7Jg  
Learn how to use Set Variable and Conditional actions to create interactive prototypes with logic and calculations. Demonstrates applying number, boolean, and string variables to build dynamic interactions like inventory counters, conditional visibility, and auto-updating component variants.


**Should you do this?**
- ✅ If you have extra time and want to learn
- ✅ If it meaningfully improves your demo
- ❌ If you're still building basic screens
- ❌ If your presentation isn't planned yet
- ❌ If it's taking hours and delaying other work

**Priority order:**
1. All your key screens are built
2. Navigation works smoothly
3. Presentation is planned and practiced
4. THEN consider fancy interactive features

## V. Rest of Class: WORK TIME

**Focus areas for today:**

**If your prototype isn't done:**
- Finish building your remaining screens
- Make sure all navigation works
- Test it yourself - click through everything

**If your prototype is mostly done:**
- Polish: consistent spacing, alignment, colors
- Test all interactive elements
- Start planning your presentation
- Divide up who's speaking when

**For everyone:**
- Create/refine your presentation slides
- Practice your demo
- Make sure your prototype link works and is shareable

---

## VI. Presentation Prep Checklist

Don't wait until Monday night to think about this! 

[FULL INSTRUCTIONS for Presentation]([../documents/](../documents/p3-hifi-deliverable.md#ii-group-presentation-requirements)

**Logistics:**
- ✅ Slides created
- ✅ Prototype link works
- ✅ Every team member has speaking part
- ✅ Practiced at least once as a team
- ✅ Under 5 minutes

**Pro tip:** Practice your demo multiple times. Know exactly which screens you'll show and what you'll click. Nothing kills a presentation like fumbling through your own prototype.
