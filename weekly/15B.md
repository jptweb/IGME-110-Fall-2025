# Week 15B - P4 Work Time & Final Exam Info

## I. Today: Work Time

Use today's class to continue working on your P4 Video Advertisement. I'm available for questions and troubleshooting.

**Reminders:**
- [Week 15A Notes](15A.md) have detailed info on video editing software options

## II. Final Exam Period - Video Showcase

**There is no traditional final exam for this course.** Instead, we'll use the final exam period for an optional video showcase where you can present your P4 video to the class.

### Combined Exam Session

Both sections are invited to a **single combined session**:

| Date | Time | Location |
|------|------|----------|
| **Monday, December 15, 2025** | 8:00 AM - 10:30 AM | **Zoom** (link TBA) |

Yes, it's early. But this gives everyone maximum time to work on their videos, and you can attend from anywhere via Zoom.

*(The Friday 12/12 session listed in SIS will NOT be used - that's too soon after the rough cut is due.)*

## III. Video Showcase Bonus Opportunity

Want to boost your P4 grade? Participate in the video showcase for up to **5 bonus points** (score up to 105/100 on P4).

### How to Earn the Bonus

To receive the 5-point bonus, you must meet **ALL THREE** conditions:

1. **Submit the signup form before the final exam period**
   - Form link: *(coming soon)*
   - Include a working link to your video
   - Indicate whether you want to present
   - Indicate whether you can attend the Dec 15 session

2. **Attend the Zoom session on December 15**
   - Be present to watch other students' videos
   - Support your classmates!

3. **Agree to have your video shown**
   - Your video will be queued up and played for the class
   - Be ready to briefly introduce it or answer questions

### What if I Have an Exam Conflict?

If you have a **documented conflict** with the December 15 exam period (another final scheduled at the same time), you can still earn the bonus! Just:
- Reach out to me **ahead of time** to get approval
- Submit the form with your video link
- Agree to have your video shown during the session (even if you can't attend live)

This way no one is penalized for having a legitimate scheduling conflict.

### Important Notes

- Your video does **NOT** need to be 100% final/perfect for the showcase
  - The actual P4 final deadline is **December 16** (see myCourses for exact time)
  - But it should be close to done - this is essentially a preview
- This is a great opportunity if:
  - You're concerned about your grade and want the bonus points
  - You're proud of your work and want to show it off
  - You want to see what your classmates created
- **Attendance alone is not enough** - you must also submit the form AND present your video

---

## IV. Not Presenting? Still Come!

Even if you're not submitting a video for the showcase, you're **strongly encouraged** to attend the Zoom session on December 15. It's optional, but:

- See what your classmates created
- Celebrate the end of the semester together
- We might have some fun activities mixed in... maybe a trivia game show with real prizes (candy you can collect at the start of spring semester)

It's a nice way to wrap up the course!
