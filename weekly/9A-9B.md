# 9A & 9B Consolidated Notes

## Class 9A / Tuesday

### Figma Prototyping
Today you will follow me along as we learn how to create prototypes in Figma. The good news is that even if your "Pro/Student" account wasn't
approved you, you can still follow along.

#### Steps to Follow:

1. Open Figma https://www.figma.com/
2. Sign in with you credentials 
> (likely using the signin with Google and your g.rit.edu account)
(You don’t need the Student/Pro version to follow along today!)
3. Follow along with what we do in class. I will post a guide AFTER class; but I don't want people getting distracted by it so this will be posted around 4:00 pm on 2/21/2025.

**RULES for todays Prototyping demo**
- Don’t get ahead of me! 
  - It may seem painfully slow but if you race ahead it will cause problems in subsequent steps
- IF STUCK – raise hand immediately. If you fall two steps behind it may be impossible for me to help. SO RAISE hand immediately.
- LOOK at  ME / Projector when asked to do so!  I expect you to not have your heads buried in the screens when I am giving steps. Many Figma settings are hard to find; if you just listen or get distracted you will miss important things.
- The actual prototype we build will take an hour; but when you do it a second time it can take 5 mintues! SO please be patient and stay with me today.

#### You Do (what to do after class)
