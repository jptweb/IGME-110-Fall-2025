# Week 5B

## I. Questions about the *Creating a GitHub Pages Site* HW?
- Requirements are here --> [Creating a GitHub Pages Site](../exercises/github-pages-site.md) 
- TWO things need to be posted to the myCourses dropbox ...
- #1 - a ZIP containing the 4 HTML pages you made all the **"YOU DO"** changes to, meaning **minimal.html**, **links.html**, **tacos.html** and **dice-roller.html**
- #2 - a link to your functioning GitHub Pages web site:
  - this should be at `https://yourGitHubld.github.io/` (where `yourGitHubld` is your actual github login)
  - example - my Github login is `tonethar` - and this is the link to my GitHub Pages Web Site - https://tonethar.github.io/
    - BTW - there's not much here - just 2 HyperText links (with `<a>` tags, remember?) to a couple of code demos
  - ***\*\*IMPORTANT\*\**** --> ***YOUR GitHub Pages web site needs to have at least 5 functioning hypertext links (to sites from the "Listicles" exercise or similar)***

## II. GitHub Pages Examples

1) Prof Example 
 
    - My Github login is `tonethar` - and this is the link to my GitHub repos - https://github.com/tonethar
    - The repo where I am posting my HTML web files is `tonethar.github.io` and that is located here - https://github.com/tonethar/tonethar.github.io
      - note the **index.html** file in the repo - that's going to be the "home page"
    - Therefore the web address of my GitHub home page is https://tonethar.github.io/
      - note what we are seeing here is the **index.html** page is now rendered by the web browser

2) Now let's take a look at some of the early assignment submissions to myCourses and see what people came up with (and if they are missing anything)

## IV. In-class Exercise - Transmedia "Round Robin"/"Telephone" game


- Your instructor will divide you into groups of three or four students for this exercise, and assign you a group number. At the end of the group activity, youâ€™ll have a short individual writeup to complete.
- Your instructor will give your group an idea to start with - *don't share the story idea with any other groups!*

### Round 1 - Get Started
- For the first ten minute round, your group will create a 100-word story based on the content. After the ten minutes are up, pass your story on to another group. Before you pass the team's paper, write your group number on the top of it.

### Round 2 - Visual Adaptation
- For the second ten-minute round, your group will take the text content from another group and create a 3 panel comic strip on a new piece of paper. Write the *other group's number* (the group that created the story) on the comic. After the ten minutes are up, pass the comic you created (only) on to another group.

### Round 3 - Interactive Story
- For the third ten-minute round, your group will take the visual adaptation from another group and create a "choose your own adventure" flow chart for it. Write the comic number (which refers to the group that created the original story) on the interactive story. Create this interactive story on a new piece of paper. After the ten minutes are up, pass the interactive story you created (only) on to another group.

### Round 4 - Another Story
- For the last ten-minute round, your group will take the flow chart from another group, and create a 100-word story based on it. Create this final story on a new piece of paper. Write the interactive story number (which refers to the group that created the original story) on this final story.

### Group Discussion
- After all four rounds are complete, each group will collect all four versions of your original content (text, visual, and flow chart, and the final story). As a group, discuss the following questions:
  - How did the content evolve across versions?
  - What core elements remained throughout all four?
  - What elements were significantly different?

### Submission to Slack
- Upload images to Slack by replying to the "Transmedia Assignment Submissions" thread in your section-specific Slack channel
- In your reply, be sure to list your group number, group name, group members, and to attach images reflecting the results all 4 rounds. Also include your original prompt! (either type it in, or post an image)
- Only 1 submission per team, please

### Submission to myCourses 
- After the discussion, each person will write up a brief (1-2 paragraph) summary of what the differences were. You can summarize what your group said, or you can share your own individual perspective.
  - ***put this into a Word DOC or PDF and post to the dropbox no later than 11:59PM tonight***
  - EACH member of the group must make an *individual* submission to myCourses
