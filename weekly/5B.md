# 5B Notes

## I. Questions about the *Creating a GitHub Pages Site* HW?
- requirements are here --> [Creating a GitHub Pages Site](../exercises/github-pages-site.md) 
- TWO things need to be posted to the myCourses dropbox ...
- #1 - a ZIP containing the 4 HTML pages you made all the **"YOU DO"** changes to, meaning **minimal.html**, **links.html**, **tacos.html** and **dice-roller.html**
- #2 - a link to your functioning GitHub Pages web site:
  - this should be at `https://yourGitHubld.github.io/` (where `yourGitHubld` is your actual github login)
  - example - my Github login is `tonethar` - and this is the link to my GitHub Pages Web Site - https://tonethar.github.io/
    - BTW - there's not much here - just 2 HyperText links (with `<a>` tags, remember?) to a couple of code demos
  - ***\*\*IMPORTANT\*\**** --> ***YOUR GitHub Pages web site needs to have at least 5 functioning hypertext links (to sites from the "Listicles" exercise or similar)***

## II. GitHub Pages Examples

1) Prof Example 
 
  - My Github login is `tonethar` - and this is the link to my GitHub repos - https://github.com/tonethar
  - The repo where I am posting my HTML web files is `tonethar.github.io` and that is located here - https://github.com/tonethar/tonethar.github.io
    - note the **index.html** file in the repo - that's going to be the "home page"
  - Therefore the web address of my GitHub home page is https://tonethar.github.io/
    - note what we are seeing here is the **index.html** page is now rendered by the web browser
  
2) Now let's take a look at some of the early assignment submissions to myCourses and see what people came up with (and if they are missing anything)
