# Week 9B: Why We Prototype

## I. Project Updates
- **P2 Final Infographic** - All submitted! 
- **Week 10 Study Guide** - Due soon (check myCourses) - This is a new study guide NOT the figma one. I added it mid day last Monday so maybe you haven't seen it yet?
- **P3 Prototype Teams** - These will be NEW teams! You will be Assigned Next week. Please do your best to make it to class next week.

## II. Why Build Interactive Prototypes?

### The Problem with Building Without Planning

[Winchester Mystery House Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Mystery_House)
- 38 years of continuous construction
- 10 kitchens, stairs to nowhere, doors opening to walls
- Built without an architect's blueprint

#### How does this connect to UI/UX?
[Winchester-housing: what is it and how to avoid it](https://joellipton.medium.com/winchester-housing-what-is-it-and-how-to-avoid-it-b823ca4894be ) a Medium.com article connecting this house to UI.



**In digital products, this looks like:**
- Confusing navigation
- Features nobody uses
- Buttons that don't work as expected
- We'll check out a bad interface at end of class...

## III. Three Core Truths of Design

### Truth #1: Good design is user-centric
Your product exists to solve problems for **other people**, not you.

### Truth #2: You are not the user
The biggest rookie mistake designers make is assuming everyone thinks like them.

### Truth #3: It can always be better
Professional designers go through many rounds of feedback and revision.

> **For Project 3 (prototype):** When your team designs your prototype, constantly ask: "Who is this for? What problem does it solve for THEM?"

## IV. Working Within Constraints

You're rarely starting from scratch. Real-world design means working with:
- **Brand guidelines** (colors, fonts, tone)
- **Platform conventions** (iOS vs Android)
- **Technical limitations** (what's possible to build)

Examples:
- [RIT Brand Portal](https://www.rit.edu/brandportal/)
- [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/)
- [Google Material Design](https://m3.material.io/)

> **For Project 3 (prototype):** Your team will need to decide:
> - What platform is your prototype for? (mobile app? web? something else?)
> - What design patterns do users already expect on that platform?
> - What's realistic to prototype in Figma within your timeline?

## V. The Blueprint Process

### 1. User Flows
**What it is:** Diagrams showing how users move through your product

**Example:** Landing Page → Learn How It Works → Find Category → Select Category → View Results

### 2. Wireframes
**What it is:** Low-fidelity sketches showing layout and structure

**Focus on:** "Where things go" not "how things look"

### 3. Prototypes
**What it is:** Interactive versions users can actually click through

**Purpose:** Test with real people BEFORE you waste time building the wrong thing

> **For Project 3 (prototype):** Don't jump right into prototyping. Each of these steps build on each other.  Each step prevents you from building the Winchester House.

## VI. Why Prototyping Matters

Prototypes let you test usability with real users before you invest months in development.

**What you just built in Figma:**
- Not just a pretty picture
- A testable experience
- Something you could hand to someone tomorrow and watch them use

Several great applications already exist that allow you to conduct usability studies with your Figma Prototypes such as: https://maze.co/integrations/figma/ "Run usability tests on high fidelity designs in minutes—and collect actionable results in hours." Catching usability issues BEFORE building the app can make or break a startup.
