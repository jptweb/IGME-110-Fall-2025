# Week 3B

---

## I. Project 1 - Product Proposal - DRAFT - Critiques!

- Did the Summary/Conclusion writer post the link to your Product Proposal draft to the ***Week 3B - P1 Drafts - Links GO HERE*** thread in your section-specific Slack channel?
  - If not, do so now. ONE post per team please
- **TODAY:** In-class critiques of 2 draft product proposals
  - [In-class critique process is here](../documents/p1-draft-peer-eval.md)
- **BEFORE YOU LEAVE TODAY:**
  - post the link to the first critique your team worked on to the appropriate Slack channel (even if you are not done with it)
  - (you can post the link to your second critique if you want to)
- When will the final version be due? 
  - a week from this Sunday, on Sunday 9/21
  - you will likely have just a little in-class group time next week, so plan on finishing this up outside of class
- **BEFORE OUR NEXT CLASS MEETING:**
  - be sure to take a look at the critiques of your draft that are linked from Slack
  - we will likely take a peek at the current state of the drafts at the beginning of our next class meetings, so if you have time to consider the feedback you have received and update your drafts, do so
