# Week 3B

---

## I. Project 1 - Product Proposal DRAFT - Let's Critique!

    
- **TODAY:** In-class critiques of 2 draft product proposals
- [In-class critique process is here](../documents/p1-draft-peer-eval.md)
- **BEFORE YOU LEAVE TODAY:**
  - You will need to post TWO links to Slack, and there's also a myCourses dropbox to submit to. You must complete and submit at least ONE of the two today in class!
    
- **WHEN WILL THE FINAL VERSION OF OUR PROPOSALS BE DUE?**
  - a week from this Sunday, on Sunday 9/21
  - you will likely have just a little in-class group time next week, so plan on finishing this up outside of class
    
- **BEFORE OUR NEXT CLASS MEETING:**
  - be sure to take a look at the critiques of your draft that are linked from Slack
  - we will likely take a peek at the current state of the drafts at the beginning of our next class meetings, so if you have time to consider the feedback you have received and update your drafts, do so
