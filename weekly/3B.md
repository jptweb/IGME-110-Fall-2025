# Week 3B

## I. Project 1 - Product Proposal DRAFT - Let's Critique!

**TODAY:** In-class peer critiques of draft proposals
- **[â†’ Click here for critique instructions & template](../documents/p1-draft-peer-eval.md)**
- Each team will review 2 other proposals
- You MUST complete at least ONE review in class today

**BEFORE YOU LEAVE TODAY:**
- Post your critique doc links to Slack (in the "P1 Drafts - Peer Evals" thread)
- Submit to myCourses dropbox
- Complete at least ONE of your two assigned reviews

**FINAL PROPOSAL DUE:** 
- Sunday 9/21 (a week from this Sunday)
- Limited in-class time next week - plan to finish outside of class
- A final version of the rubric (what we will grade your project 1 app proposal against) has been added here! We haven't decided the exact point totals of each item, but this is what you want to use to ensure you have met all objectives before handing in your final app proposal! [P1 Rubric For App Proposal FINAL](https://github.com/jptweb/IGME-110-Fall-2025/blob/main/documents/p1-rubric-final.md)

**BEFORE NEXT CLASS:**
- Check Slack for critiques of YOUR proposal
- we will likely take a peek at the current state of the drafts at the beginning of our next class meetings, so if you have time to consider the feedback you have received and update your drafts, do so
