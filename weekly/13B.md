## II. Digital Audio Basics

### Understanding Audio File Formats
Digital audio comes in several formats, each with different characteristics:

**Lossless Formats** (preserve all audio data):
- **WAV** - Uncompressed, highest quality, large file sizes. Standard for professional audio work.
- **AIFF** - Apple's equivalent to WAV, also uncompressed.

**Lossy Formats** (compress by removing some audio data):
- **MP3** - Most common format, good compression with acceptable quality loss. Universal compatibility.
- **AAC** - Better quality than MP3 at similar file sizes. Used by Apple and YouTube.
- **OGG** - Open-source alternative to MP3, good quality and compression.

### Key Concepts
- **Sample Rate** - How many times per second audio is recorded (measured in Hz). CD quality is 44,100 Hz (44.1 kHz). Higher sample rates capture more detail but create larger files.
- **Bit Depth** - How much information is captured in each sample. 16-bit is CD quality, 24-bit and 32-bit are used for professional recording and editing.
- **Channels** - Mono (1 channel) vs. Stereo (2 channels - left and right)

### Practical Guidelines
- Use **WAV** for editing and production work (like this class!)
- Export to **MP3** or **AAC** for final delivery and web use
- Higher quality settings mean larger file sizes - balance quality with practical needs

## III. Audacity

### III-A. Audacity HW
- See myCourses dropbox start files (**Digital Audio Files.zip**)
- **Installing Audacity:** When downloading from audacityteam.org, choose the option to download **without Muse Hub** - you don't need it for this course, and it will save you time and disk space.
- You will be given time in class on 13B to work on this activity. If you don't already have experience working with Audacity, please watch this tutorial before beginning. (NOTE: Please make sure that you're using Audacity 3.0 or higher; versions below that don't use the unified .aup3 file format.)
