## III. Course Overview

This class is a "big picture" overview of the study of interactive media (which includes games!), ranging from social and legal aspects of media through the underlying technical aspects of various media types. You will learn research, analysis, and communication skills using a variety of media, including text, images, audio, and video.

By the end of the class, you will be able to:

- Research topics in interactive media
- Critically assess the quality of information resources
- Recognize and apply relevant legal and ethical principles in the creation and use of media
- Create media in a variety of formats, incorporating knowledge of underlying technical concepts
- Effectively communicate ideas through written argument, graphics, interactive prototypes, and video.

## IV. Grading

In this class, you will have weekly required activities, including at-home study guides and in-class exercises. There will also be four projects — two done in groups, and two done individually.

### Grade Breakdown

| Component | Weight |
|:----------|:-------|
| Weekly Study Guides | 25% |
| In-Class Activities | 15% |
| Project 1 - Group App Proposal | 12% |
| Project 2 - Individual Infographic | 13% |
| Project 3 - Group Prototype | 12% |
| Project 4 - Individual Video | 13% |
| Attendance | 10% |

### Grade Scale

| Grade | Range |
|:------|:------|
| A | 90% to 100% |
| B | 80% to 89.99% |
| C | 70% to 79.99% |
| D | 65% to 69.99% |
| F | < 65% |

### Attendance

Unexcused absences will result in the following grade adjustments:

- One unexcused absence = no adjustment
- Two unexcused absences = -20% to attendance grade (i.e. -2% off final course grade)
- Three unexcused absences = -50% to attendance grade (i.e. -5% off final course grade)
- Four unexcused absences = -100% to attendance grade (i.e. -10% off final course grade)
- Five or more unexcused absences = another 5% off of final course grade per absence

***Note: Being late to class is considered ½ of an absence***

### Late Policy

Except in documented extenuating circumstances, assignments completed or turned in after their due date will not be accepted for credit without PRIOR approval. If you are having problems with an assignment or have an emergency that may make you late in submitting your work, contact your instructor as soon as possible.

### Challenging Grades

If you believe you received an incorrect grade on an assignment, you need to let us know in a timely manner (typically within a week of receiving the grade).

## Study Guides (25%)

This class will use a "flipped classroom" model in which you'll do readings and watch videos on your own, and then use the class time for activities and project work. Because these materials are critical to helping you build the skills necessary for the activities, you'll be provided with a weekly study guide to complete.

## In-Class Activities (15%)

Class time will primarily be used for hands-on activities building off of the required readings and videos for that week. There will also be in-class time to work on your projects. If you have to miss a class, you *must* contact your instructor before that class begins to make alternate arrangements.

## Project 1: Group App Proposal Document (12%)

Your first project will involve creating a proposal document for a technical product—a game, an app, or a website. Your group will need to thoroughly research the topic, and present a compelling case for why an investor would want to support the development of the product.

## Project 2: Individual Infographic (13%)

For your second project, you will each create an infographic to illustrate key concepts and elements of your proposed product.

## Project 3: Group Prototype (12%)

Your group will choose one proposal to prototype. This is a "lo-fi" prototype, which means the focus is on content, layout, and interaction—not on visual design.

## Project 4: Individual Video Advertisement (13%)

Using the prototype and the mockups as a guide, you will create a video advertisement for your product.

## V. Class Communication

### V-a. Contacting Your Instructor

For topics relating specifically to you or your work, you can contact your instructor or TA via Slack. If you have not received a response within 24 hours (not including weekends or holidays), please send a follow-up.

For more general questions or comments about course material, we'd much prefer you use Slack — not only does that help us build community, it also allows either the instructor or TA to respond, and makes the answers available to anyone else in the course who may have the same questions.

### V-b. Office Hours

Office hours offer you the opportunity to ask individual questions about the course material that you may have not had time to ask in class. They're held on a first-come-first-served drop-in basis with no appointment necessary. Sometimes office hours become increasingly busy the closer it is to a deadline. If students are waiting, discussions will be limited to ~10 minutes/student. Plan your use of office hours accordingly.

If you need more time, or can't make regularly scheduled office hours, check with your instructor about scheduling an appointment.

### V-c. myCourses Announcements

We will provide any course announcements through the Announcements on the Course Home Page. This includes any updates or changes to assignments or other course assignments, as well as general comments about assignment results or discussions. Those announcements will automatically be shared in the course Slack workspace, as well. Please check Slack and/or myCourses daily so that you don't miss important notifications.

### V-d. Name & Pronouns

Many people go by a name in daily life that is different from their legal name. In this course, we seek to address everyone in the manner that best respects their identity. You are invited (publicly or privately) to share the name and pronouns you wish us to use.

Additionally, you can:

- [Provide pronoun information in myCourses](https://help.rit.edu/sp?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0043913&sys_kb_id=591e760d47c5c2109b2d98e8536d43de&spa=1)
- Change your "preferred name" in most RIT systems (including myCourses, Slack, Zoom, email, the RIT directory, and mail sent to your home address) by going to [https://start.rit.edu/](https://start.rit.edu/) → Directory Information → Name Preferences Page

## VI. Other Course Policies

### VI-a. Food in the Classroom

No food or liquids other than water is allowed in the classroom. Critically, foods containing nuts such as peanuts or tree nuts are not allowed as many people will have a severe allergic reaction to even trace amounts of nuts left behind on a shared keyboard or mouse.

### VI-b. Missing Class

In the case of an illness or unexpected absence, we expect you to notify us *before* class.

It is your responsibility to find out how to make up work from a missed class. Absences in any form do not postpone due dates without permission from your instructor.

### VI-c. Class Cancellation

If class is canceled, announcements will be posted in myCourses and Slack. We highly recommend that you check Slack before class just to be sure.

### VI-d. Use of Generative AI Tools

Generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Midjourney, and others) can be very helpful, but they also pose some risks—not just because they may provide inaccurate responses, but also because they make it very easy for you to avoid learning core concepts that are fundamental building blocks in advanced work.

This semester, we'll be working with some of those tools so you can see how they can be used most effectively. In general, however, whenever you use an AI tool to create content that you submit in a class, you must explicitly acknowledge that in your submission, including a transcript of the chat showing your prompts and the system responses. Failure to follow this rule will be considered an academic integrity violation.

***Exception: For assignments that explicitly allow the use of generative AI, it is not necessary to submit a chat transcript.***

### VI-e. Final Grades

#### Grade Challenges

At the end of the semester, any questions about the final grading of the course should be raised immediately. RIT policy gives students one semester to challenge any grade.

#### Incomplete Policy

Incomplete ("I") grades are reserved for cases in which you are making consistent course progress, and then something occurs in your life that prevents you from completing the course. Incomplete grades are not a mechanism to delay a failing grade nor are they a means to stave off probation or a suspension. For an instructor to grant an incomplete, credible documentation must be provided at the instructor's or school's request.

### VI-f. Statement on Academic Accommodations

RIT is committed to providing academic accommodations to students with disabilities. If you would like to request academic accommodations such as testing modifications due to a disability, please contact the Disability Services Office. Contact information for the DSO and information about how to request accommodations can be found at www.rit.edu/dso. After you receive academic accommodation approval, it is imperative that you contact me as early as possible so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.

### VI-g. Academic Integrity

IGM classes follow the university level guidelines, contained in [D08.0 Student Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.rit.edu/policies/d080).

### VI-h. Title IX

Title IX violations are taken very seriously at RIT. RIT is committed to investigate complaints of sexual discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault and other sexual misconduct, and to ensure that appropriate action is taken to stop the behavior, prevent its recurrence and remedy its effects. Please view the [Title IX Rights & Resources at RIT](https://www.rit.edu/fa/compliance/content/title-ix).

RIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website. RIT's policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender-based discrimination and harassment with RIT's Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators, regardless of whether the incidents are stated to them in person or shared by students as part of their coursework.

If you have a concern related to gender-based discrimination and/or harassment and prefer to have a confidential discussion, assistance is available from one of RIT's confidential resources on campus (listed below).
