# Project 4: Video Advertisement - Rough Cut

Create a rough cut of your video advertisement that demonstrates your progress so far. The video should present the core structure, tone, and key elements of your advertisement, even if all content is not finalized.

## AI & Editing Tools Policy

This project is designed to give you hands-on experience with video editing software. The skills you build here—working with timelines, making cuts, mixing audio, timing transitions—are foundational for future coursework and professional work.

**You MAY use AI tools for:**
- Brainstorming your concept or script
- Generating or finding background music
- Creating graphics or images to include in your video
- Generating short video clips to use as assets

**You MUST do the following yourself using editing software (Shotcut recommended):**
- Assemble all footage/images on a timeline
- Make all cuts, transitions, and timing decisions
- Mix and adjust audio levels
- Export the final video

**You may NOT use:**
- AI video generation tools to create your entire video or complete sequences
- Auto-edit features that assemble your video for you

**Required with submission:** A screenshot of your editing timeline showing your assembled project.

## Instructions

### 1. Use Your Plan as a Guide
Refer to your planning document to align your rough cut with your chosen prototype, target audience, and video type.

### 2. Create a Rough Cut Video
- **Length:** The rough cut does not need to meet the exact 60–90 second requirement but should have a significant amount of content to demonstrate the intended pacing and overall flow of your video.
- **Core Elements to Include:**
  - **Introduction:** A basic opening scene or sequence to hook your audience.
  - **Key Feature or Experience:** Show at least one core aspect of the prototype or experience the video will highlight.
  - **Placeholder Content:** Use temporary visuals, text, or audio where necessary to outline incomplete parts.

### 3. Focus on Progress, Not Perfection
The rough cut can include:
- Storyboard images as placeholders for animations or live footage
- Rough audio using placeholder narration or text-to-speech
- Basic transitions or static visuals to outline the flow of the video

### 4. Add a Title Card and Credits
- Include a title card introducing the prototype
- Add placeholder credits to account for any assets you plan to use

### 5. Prepare a Reflection Document
Write a brief reflection (150–200 words) answering the following:
- What progress have you made so far?
- What areas still need significant work?
- What do you plan to improve or change for the final version?

Include an updated storyboard/script showing any changes from your original plan.
