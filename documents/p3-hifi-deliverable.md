# Project 3 - Interactive Digital Prototype - Deliverables #3a/b & #4
## *Hi-Fi Prototype & Presentation*

---

## Overview

After conducting usability testing in Week 11B (Nov 5/6), you now have valuable feedback to guide your high-fidelity prototype development. This document covers:

- **Week 12B:** Progress Check (In-Class Participation)
- **Deliverable #3:** Final Prototype & Presentation (Week 13A) - **MAIN EVENT**
- **Deliverable #4:** Peer Evaluation & Reflection (Week 13B) - See separate document

**Important Note:** You already did the critical usability testing with your lo-fi prototypes. That's where you discovered the big issues and missing features. Now it's time to polish and present!

## WEEK 12B: Hi-Fi Prototype Progress Check
**(In-Class Participation - 10% of P3 Grade)**

### Quick Overview

This is an **informal progress check** to ensure you're on track for final presentations.

**What's Happening in 12B:**
1. **Share your progress in Slack** before class (screenshot or link)
2. **Last 15-20 minutes:** Quick peer feedback with another team
3. **Rest of class:** Work time

**What You Need to Show:**
- At least 2-3 screens built in hi-fi
- Basic navigation working
- Consistent design started (colors, fonts)
- Clear plan for what's left to do

**No formal submission** - just participate in class and share progress in Slack.

---

### Peer Feedback (Last 15-20 Minutes of Class)

Get a second set of eyes to spot any last-minute concerns before final presentations.

**Simple Process:**
1. Pair with another team (5 min each team)
2. Show your current prototype
3. Get quick feedback: What's working? What's confusing? What to prioritize?

**No forms, no scripts** - just helpful conversation between teams.

## DELIVERABLE #3: Final Prototype & Presentation
**Due: Week 13A (Nov 18/19) - Start of Class**

### I. Final Prototype Requirements

Your final prototype should be a **polished, fully interactive version** that incorporates feedback from your lo-fi testing and the quick peer check from 12B.

#### Final Prototype Checklist:
- ✅ All core features from your work plan are represented
- ✅ Visual design is consistent and professional throughout
- ✅ Navigation is intuitive and clearly labeled
- ✅ All interactive elements work as expected
- ✅ Content is realistic and appropriate for target audience
- ✅ Major improvements from lo-fi testing are visible
- ✅ Any obvious issues from 12B peer feedback are addressed
- ✅ Prototype is accessible via shareable link or file

#### What It Should Demonstrate:
- **Core Experience:** Clearly shows the solution to the problem from your app proposal
- **User Flow:** Can walk through at least 2-3 complete user journeys
- **Design Thinking:** Shows you understand your target audience (refer to personas)
- **Iteration:** Visible improvements from lo-fi to hi-fi based on feedback

#### Assessment Criteria for Final Prototype (30% of P3 grade):

**Prototype Quality (40%):**
- Is it polished and fully interactive?
- Does it effectively address the core experience?
- Is it user-friendly and designed for the target audience?

**Design and Functionality (30%):**
- How well does visual/interactive design align with project goals?
- Is the design engaging and functional?
- Are issues from earlier versions resolved?

**Creativity and Innovation (20%):**
- Does it show creative thinking in addressing the core experience?
- Is the solution well thought out and engaging?

**Incorporation of Feedback (10%):**
- Are improvements based on user testing evident?
- Does the final version show iteration and refinement?

---

### II. Group Presentation Requirements

**Time Limit: 5-7 minutes + 2-3 minutes Q&A**

Your group will pitch your digital prototype to the class as if presenting to stakeholders or investors. Show off what you built and your process!

#### Presentation Structure:

**Important: All team members must speak during the presentation for full credit.** How you divide the sections is up to your team - be strategic about who presents what based on strengths and contributions.

**Suggested Structure (5-7 minutes total):**

**1. Introduction & Problem (1 min)**
- Introduce team members
- State app name and core problem you're solving
- Identify your target audience (reference personas)

**2. Research & Design Evolution (1-2 min)**
- Show the original app proposal/infographic that inspired you
- Brief walkthrough of design evolution:
  - 1-2 lo-fi screens → corresponding hi-fi screens
  - How feedback from testing improved the design

**3. Live Demo (2-3 min)** ⭐ **MAIN FOCUS**
- Walk through 2-3 core user flows
- Show key interactive elements in action
- Explain navigation and main features
- Highlight your best design decisions

**4. Testing & Iteration (1 min)**
- Brief overview of testing process (lo-fi and 12B peer feedback)
- Share 2-3 specific improvements from user feedback:
  - "Users couldn't find X, so we added Y"
  - "Navigation was confusing, so we changed Z"

**5. Conclusion (30 sec)**
- Summarize project impact
- "Imagine if..." statement about the app's potential
- Thank the audience and invite questions

**How to Divide Presentation Duties:**

Your team has flexibility in how you organize this. Here are some approaches:

**Option A: By Project Phase**
- Person 1: Intro + Research (sections 1-2)
- Person 2: Demo (section 3)
- Person 3: Testing + Conclusion (sections 4-5)

**Option B: By Role**
- Project Manager: Intro + Conclusion
- Design/Developer: Demo + Design decisions
- Tester: Research context + Feedback/iteration

**Option C: Equal Rotation**
- Each person presents 2 sections
- Rotate who's speaking every 1-2 minutes

**The key:** Make sure transitions between speakers are smooth and everyone contributes meaningfully.

---

#### Presentation Best Practices:

**Do:**
- ✅ **Practice together multiple times!** (timing is critical)
- ✅ Test prototype beforehand - have backup screenshots ready
- ✅ Use slides for context, but focus demo time on the prototype
- ✅ Speak clearly and show enthusiasm for your project
- ✅ Have smooth transitions between speakers
- ✅ Know the ENTIRE project, not just your role (for Q&A)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Read from slides word-for-word
- ❌ Spend too long on context - get to the demo!
- ❌ Apologize for what's not done - focus on what works!
- ❌ Let one person dominate - everyone should speak
- ❌ Wing it - practice prevents disasters

---

#### Presentation Assessment Criteria (35% of P3 grade):

**Clarity and Organization (20%):**
- Well-organized with clear structure?
- Effectively communicates goals and process?

**Prototype Demonstration (30%):**
- Demo is clear and functional?
- Explains how prototype captures the core experience?

**Team Collaboration (20%):**
- All members contribute meaningfully?
- Smooth transitions and cohesive presentation?

**Incorporation of Feedback (15%):**
- Explains how feedback improved the prototype?
- Improvements are clearly demonstrated?

**Engagement and Q&A (15%):**
- Engaging delivery and strong pitch?

## Remember

You already did the hard work of **discovering problems** with lo-fi testing. That's where real learning happened - you found missing features, confusing navigation, and usability issues when they were easy to fix.

Now your job is to:
1. **Build** a polished version that addresses what you learned
2. **Show** your process and final product with confidence

You've got this! Show us what you built!
