##  *Work Plan, Features & Personas*

- For this deliverable, your group will create a work plan that outlines the steps you will take to develop and pitch your digital prototype

## I. Requirements
- This plan will serve as a roadmap for your project and must include project goals, roles, responsibilities, tasks, timelines. 
- Although each group member will guide the team in a specific role(s) as outlined below, everyone is expected to contribute to all parts of the project.
- Your work plan must include the following components:

### 1) Project Goal and App Proposal Analysis
- **A)** Begin by clearly defining your project goal based on the **app proposal** your group selected. Explain why you chose that particular app concept, analyze the original proposal, and explain how it serves as the foundation for your prototype project.
- **B)** Identify the core experience that your prototype will address - what is the main problem this app solves?
- **C)** Come up with a draft list of 5 to 7 features of your app (don't worry, you won't be required to implement all of these features in your prototype!)

### 2) Target Audience & User Personas

**A) Identify the Primary Target Audience**

Identify the primary target audience for your project. Consider the infographic's original message and who would benefit most from the solution or information presented in your prototype. Describe how the needs and preferences of this audience will shape the design and functionality of your prototype.

**B) Create 3 Professional User Personas**

Create a minimum of 3 **visual persona documents** - one for each type of user. In professional UX design, personas are visual documents with photos and organized information, NOT just paragraphs of text.

**Resources:**
- Industry standard guide → [NNGroup: Personas Study Guide](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/personas-study-guide/)
- Visual examples → [NNGroup: Persona Template Examples](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/persona-template/)
- More examples → [UX Design: How to Create User Personas](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/putting-personas-to-work-in-ux-design/)

**Required Personas:**
- **Persona #1:** Primary target audience (the main person this app is designed for)
- **Persona #2:** Power user (someone who will use the app frequently/extensively)
- **Persona #3:** Casual user (someone who will use the app occasionally/minimally)

#### ⚠️ IMPORTANT - What Makes a Professional Persona?

Personas in the UX industry are **visual documents**, not just text. Each persona should include:

**❌ BAD Example (Text Only - Unprofessional):**
> "Sarah, 20, college student. Needs to organize her schedule."

**✅ GOOD Example (Visual Persona Document):**

<img width="800" alt="good-persona" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/943f5636-a7ae-4746-b4d5-7d3435abb678" />

**Each persona document must include:**

**Visual Elements:**
- A realistic photo (use stock photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com), or [Generated Photos](https://generated.photos))
- Clean, organized layout (can be created in Canva, Figma, PowerPoint, or Photoshop)

**Required Information:**
- **Name & Basic Demographics:** Age, occupation, location
- **Background/Bio:** Brief description of their life situation and context
- **Goals:** What they want to accomplish (2-4 bullet points)
- **Frustrations/Pain Points:** Current problems they face (2-4 bullet points)
- **Tech Comfort Level:** How comfortable are they with technology?
- **Quote:** In their own words - what would they say about the problem? (1-2 sentences)
- **Scenarios:** When/why/how would they use your app? (brief description)

**Tools You Can Use:**
- Canva (has persona templates)
- Figma (create your own layout)
- PowerPoint/Google Slides
- Photoshop
- Any design tool that lets you combine images and text

**Pro Tip:** Look at real persona examples from the resources above to see how professional UX designers present this information visually.

### 3) Roles and Responsibilities
- While ALL group members should participate in EVERY stage of the project, each member will take on a guiding role to help keep the group organized and focused in specific areas:
  - ***Project Manager***: Guides organization, scheduling, and task management.
  - ***Research Lead***: Directs research and analysis of the infographic and supporting data, as well as brainstorming of features and personas. Smaller groups might want to share this role equally.
