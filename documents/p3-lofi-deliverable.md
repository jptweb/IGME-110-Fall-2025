# Project 3 - Interactive Digital Prototype - deliverable #2
## *Lo-Fi mockups and in-class testing*

---

## Prerequisites
- You should have defined the core functionality of your app, have at least 5 to 7 possible features in mind, and have defined at least 3 *user personas*

---

## I. Overview
- In class, your group will present a LoFi (wireframe) version of your Interactive Digital Prototype.
- The purpose of this LoFi version is to gather meaningful feedback from your users (classmates), which will inform concept and design improvements BEFORE you create a HiFi working prototype.
- Your group will also create a list of *use cases* designed to collect information on the usability, design, and concept of your project.
- Heres an example of a hypothetical submission: [P3 Deliverable #2 Example: MealMate Recipe App](p3-lofi-example.md)

## II. Assignment Requirements
- 1. A minimum of **SEVEN *User Flow Diagrams*** that map out at least 7 distinct "journeys" that your users (the personas you created in deliverable #1) will have while attempting to accomplish their goals on your app. You should create flows for each of your three personas:
      - **Primary user** (3 flows) - your main target audience
      - **Power user** (2 flows) - someone who uses the app extensively
      - **Casual user** (2 flows) - someone who uses it occasionally
    - Each diagram needs:
      - a **title** that explains the user action (ex. "Change shock intensity")
      - an **entry point** (ex. "App Home Screen")
      - a **series of steps** the user will need to take
        - ex. "Find Settings Button" ➡️ "Navigate to Settings Screen" ➡️ "Change Intensity to Desired Level"
      - an **end success state** (ex. "Confirm Change")
- 2. A *miniumum* of **FIVE screen mockups** (LoFi):
    - the screen mockups should demonstrate the core idea of your project and should reflect:
      - the concept you are developing based on your selected infographic.
      - the core features that will help your audience interact with the project and have a successful "journey"
      - the initial design choices that will guide the final look and feel of the project
    - the mockups can be developed on paper, or digitally using tools such as Canva, Figma OR figjam, Photoshop or others.
      - **FigJam** is made by figma and is a much quicker collaborative way to create visual stuff: https://www.figma.com/figjam/       
    - here's an example of what paper mockups could look like --> [Mobile Application Design : Paper Prototype Video (1:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y20E3qBmHpg)
    - these mockups will be tested by your peers in class
- 3. User flow and testing:
  - Choose at least FIVE of the 7 user flows you created
  - Write 5 unique **tasks** (one task per selected flow)
  - **Strategy tip:** Select tasks that cover all three personas (e.g., 2-3 from primary user, 1-2 from power user, 1 from casual user)
  - use the [provided testing template (script)](../documents/p3-wireframe-feedback-script.md)
 
### Sample Submission to benchmark your submission against
- [P3 Deliverable #2 Example: MealMate Recipe App](p3-lofi-example.md)

## III. Submission Requirements

- Submit to myCourses before the dropbox closes:
  - 7 *User Flow Diagrams* (these could be diagrammed, or easy-to-read text that is nicely formatted) - 3 for primary user, 2 for power user, 2 for casual user
  - 5 or more LoFi wireframe screen mockups (if they are on paper, take pictures)
  - 5 or more unique tasks
