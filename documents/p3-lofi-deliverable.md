# Project 3 - Interactive Digital Prototype - deliverable #2
## *Lo-Fi mockups and in-class testing*

---

## Prerequisites
- You should have defined the core functionality of your app, have at least 5 to 7 possible features in mind, and have defined at least 3 *user personas*

---

## I. Overview
- In class, your group will present a LoFi (wireframe) version of your Interactive Digital Prototype.
- The purpose of this LoFi version is to gather meaningful feedback from your users (classmates), which will inform concept and design improvements BEFORE you create a HiFi working prototype.
- Your group will also create a list of *use cases* designed to collect information on the usability, design, and concept of your project.
- Heres an example of a hypothetical submission: [P3 Deliverable #2 Example: MealMate Recipe App](p3-lofi-example.md)

## II. Assignment Requirements

### 1. User Flow Diagrams (Minimum of 7)

Create **SEVEN *User Flow Diagrams*** that map out at least 7 distinct "journeys" that your users (the personas you created in deliverable #1) will have while attempting to accomplish their goal/task on your app. 

**Distribution across personas:**
- **Primary user** (3 flows) - your main target audience
- **Power user** (2 flows) - someone who uses the app extensively
- **Casual user** (2 flows) - someone who uses it occasionally

**Each diagram needs:**
- A **title** that explains the user action (ex. "Change shock intensity")
- An **entry point** (ex. "App Home Screen")
- A **series of steps** the user will need to take
  - ex. "Find Settings Button" ➡️ "Navigate to Settings Screen" ➡️ "Change Intensity to Desired Level"
- An **end success state** (ex. "Confirm Change")

See the [User Flow Section of 11A Notes](../weekly/11A.md) for more tips on these.


### 2. Lo-Fi Screen Mockups (Minimum of 5)

Create a **minimum of FIVE screen mockups** (LoFi) that:
- Demonstrate the core idea of your project
- Reflect the concept you are developing based on your selected app proposal
- Show the core features that will help your audience interact with the project and have a successful "journey"
- Illustrate initial design choices that will guide the final look and feel

**Tools you can use:**
- **Paper sketches** (take clear photos) - see this [paper prototype video example (1:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y20E3qBmHpg)
- **Digital wireframes:** Canva, Figma, Photoshop, or others
- **FigJam** (by Figma - quick collaborative whiteboarding): https://www.figma.com/figjam/

**Note:** These mockups will be tested by your peers in class


### 3. User Flow Testing (5 Tasks)

Using the [provided testing template (script)](../documents/p3-wireframe-feedback-script.md):
- Select 5 of your user flows to test
- Create ONE testing task per flow (5 tasks total) - each task tests one complete user journey
- Optional: Within each task, add 3-5 step-by-step instructions to guide the facilitator

**Strategy tip:** Select flows/tasks that cover different personas (e.g., 2-3 from primary user, 1-2 from power user, 1 from casual user)

# A Sample Submission
**Sample Submission to benchmark your submission against:** 
**[P3 Deliverable #2 Example: MealMate Recipe App](p3-lofi-example.md)**

## III. Submission Requirements

- Submit to myCourses before the dropbox closes:
  - 7 *User Flow Diagrams* (these could be diagrammed, or easy-to-read text that is nicely formatted) - 3 for primary user, 2 for power user, 2 for casual user
  - 5 or more LoFi wireframe screen mockups (if they are on paper, take pictures)
  - 5 or more unique tasks (using the template linked above)
