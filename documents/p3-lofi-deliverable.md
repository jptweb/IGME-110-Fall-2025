# Project 3 - Deliverable #2: Lo-Fi Mockups and User Testing
(class 11A we make, class 11B we test) there are two things to submit!

## Prerequisites
- You should have defined the core functionality of your app, have at least 5 to 7 possible features in mind, and have defined at least 3 *user personas*

---

## I. Overview

This deliverable has **two parts** that are submitted separately:

### Part 1: Lo-Fi Mockups & Testing Script (Due: Before Class 11B)
Your team will create:
- **7 User Flow Diagrams** mapping out user journeys through your app
- **5+ Lo-Fi screen mockups** (wireframes) showing your core features
- **A testing script** with 5 tasks to evaluate your design

You'll work on these during class 11A, but will likely need time outside class to complete them. The purpose of these Lo-Fi materials is to gather meaningful feedback from users (your classmates) BEFORE you invest time building a Hi-Fi working prototype.

**Example submission:** [P3 Deliverable #2 Example: MealMate Recipe App](p3-lofi-example.md)

### Part 2: Testing Results (Due: After Class 11B)
During class 11B, you'll conduct usability testing with another team using your testing script from Part 1. After testing, you'll submit your completed testing results.

**See the [Week 11B Notes](../weekly/11B.md#v-after-class-complete-your-deliverable) for detailed instructions on conducting the testing session and what to submit.**

## II. Part 1: Lo-Fi Mockups & Testing Script

### 1. User Flow Diagrams (Minimum of 7)

Create **SEVEN *User Flow Diagrams*** that map out at least 7 distinct "journeys" that your users (the personas you created in deliverable #1) will have while attempting to accomplish their goal/task on your app. 

**Distribution across personas:**
- **Primary user** (3 flows) - your main target audience
- **Power user** (2 flows) - someone who uses the app extensively
- **Casual user** (2 flows) - someone who uses it occasionally

**Each diagram needs:**
- A **title** that explains the user action (ex. "Change shock intensity")
- An **entry point** (ex. "App Home Screen")
- A **series of steps** the user will need to take
  - ex. "Find Settings Button" ➡️ "Navigate to Settings Screen" ➡️ "Change Intensity to Desired Level"
- An **end success state** (ex. "Confirm Change")

See the [User Flow Section of 11A Notes](../weekly/11A.md) for more tips on these.


### 2. Lo-Fi Screen Mockups (Minimum of 5)

Create a **minimum of FIVE screen mockups** (LoFi) that:
- Demonstrate the core idea of your project
- Reflect the concept you are developing based on your selected app proposal
- Show the core features that will help your audience interact with the project and have a successful "journey"
- Illustrate initial design choices that will guide the final look and feel

**Tools you can use:**
- **Paper sketches** (take clear photos) - see this [paper prototype video example (1:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y20E3qBmHpg)
- **Digital wireframes:** Canva, Figma, Photoshop, or others
- **FigJam** (by Figma - quick collaborative whiteboarding): https://www.figma.com/figjam/

**Note:** These mockups will be tested by your peers in class 11B


### 3. User Testing Script (5 Tasks)

Using the [provided testing template (script)](../documents/p3-wireframe-feedback-script.md):
- Select 5 of your user flows to test
- Create ONE testing task per flow (5 tasks total) - each task tests one complete user journey
- Optional: Within each task, add 3-5 step-by-step instructions to guide the facilitator

**Strategy tip:** Select flows/tasks that cover different personas (e.g., 2-3 from primary user, 1-2 from power user, 1 from casual user)

### 🚨 Sample Submission
**Benchmark your submission against this example:** 
[P3 Deliverable #2 Example: MealMate Recipe App](p3-lofi-example.md)

---

## III. Part 1 Submission Requirements

- Create a document (PDF or DOCX) that contains all deliverables
- Submit to myCourses before the dropbox closes:
  - 7 *User Flow Diagrams* - 3 for primary user, 2 for power user, 2 for casual user
  - 5 or more LoFi wireframe screen mockups (if paper, include clear photos)
  - 5 testing tasks using the template
- **Team dropbox** - only one submission needed per team!

**Note:** If you created paper mockups, please also bring the physical versions to class 11B for testing.

---

## IV. Part 2: Testing Results Submission

After conducting usability testing during class 11B, you'll need to submit your completed testing results.

**For complete instructions, see:** [Week 11B Notes - Testing Results Submission](../weekly/11B.md#v-after-class-complete-your-deliverable)
