## AI & Editing Tools Policy

This project is designed to give you hands-on experience with video editing software. The skills you build here—working with timelines, making cuts, mixing audio, timing transitions—are foundational for future coursework and professional work.

**You MAY use AI tools for:**
- Brainstorming your concept or script
- Generating or finding background music
- Creating graphics or images to include in your video
- Generating short video clips to use as assets

**You MUST do the following yourself using editing software (Shotcut recommended):**
- Assemble all footage/images on a timeline
- Make all cuts, transitions, and timing decisions
- Mix and adjust audio levels
- Export the final video

**You may NOT use:**
- AI video generation tools to create your entire video or complete sequences
- Auto-edit features that assemble your video for you

**Required with submission:** A screenshot of your editing timeline showing your assembled project.

## Instructions

### 1. Review Your Rough Cut
- Review any feedback you received on your rough cut (from the instructor or classmates)
- Re-watch your rough cut with fresh eyes and identify areas to improve
- Consider visuals, audio, pacing, and narrative flow

### 2. Refine Your Video
- **Length:** Ensure the final video meets the 60–90 second requirement.
- **Structure:** Include the following elements:
  - **Introduction:** A polished opening scene that hooks your audience.
  - **Key Feature or Experience:** Highlight the core aspects of the prototype or experience you are trying to sell.
  - **Conclusion:** Summarize the value and include a call to action or a memorable closing sequence.

### 3. Polish Visuals and Audio
- Replace placeholders with finalized visuals, animations, or live footage
- Add high-quality music, sound effects, or voiceovers as appropriate to your video's style
- Ensure transitions and pacing feel smooth and professional

### 4. Include Captions
- Add captions for all spoken dialogue or key audio elements
- Captions should be clear, easy to read, and synchronized with the video

### 5. Include Required Elements
- **Title Card:** A clear and professional title introducing the prototype
- **Credits:** Provide detailed credits for any assets used (e.g., images, videos, music, AI-generated content)

### 6. Prepare a Reflection Document
Write a reflection (250–300 words) addressing the following:
- What changes or improvements did you make from your rough cut and why?
- What challenges did you overcome during this process?
- What did you learn about creating an advertisement through this project?
- **AI Documentation:** If you used any AI tools during this project (for brainstorming, generating images, creating music, etc.), briefly describe what tools you used and how they contributed to your project. This is required for transparency - there's no penalty for using AI within the allowed guidelines.

> **Important:** Failure to disclose AI use is treated the same as having someone else complete your work - it is a violation of [RIT's Academic Integrity Policy (D08.0)](https://www.rit.edu/policies/d080) and may result in a zero on the project, failure of the course, or dismissal from the university.

Attach your final storyboard or script as an appendix to show how your plan evolved.
