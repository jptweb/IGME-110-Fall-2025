# Project 2: Infographic Project Plan

## Overview
You need to begin your infographic project with a plan for how to proceed. You'll select one app proposal from Project 1 to base your infographic on, then create a comprehensive plan for your design approach.

## Available Proposals
**Browse all app proposals here:**  
→ [App Proposal Finals (PDFs)](https://github.com/jptweb/IGME-110-Fall-2025/tree/main/documents/app-proposal-finals) (sections 2 and 8)

→ [App Proposal Finals (PDFs) - sections 04/05/06/09](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-110-Fall-2025/tree/main/documents/_app-proposal-finals)




*Tip: Use the sidebar to quickly jump between proposals to review them efficiently*

You may choose ANY proposal from the collection - it doesn't have to be from your own team's work.

## Important Context
Keep in mind that infographics are primarily intended for displaying data in an easy-to-understand visual context. As a result, you'll be drawing from the research that was done on the product, and finding a way to display that in a visually compelling way. It's also quite likely that you'll need to supplement that research with some of your own.

## Required Sections

### 1. Proposal Selection
**Explain which proposal you decided to work with and why.**
- What was it about that particular proposal that made you want to select it? 
- There should be clear intent behind your reasoning, not just "because I felt like it."
- Consider what visual opportunities the proposal offers

### 2. Target Audience & Goals
**Describe who the infographic is targeted at and what you want to accomplish with it.**
- Watch the "Five Ws of Success" in the LinkedIn Learning Infographics course for details on what to include: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-infographic-design-14154168/defining-the-5-ws
- Focus especially on the "What" and "Who" sections
- Be specific about your infographic's purpose (inform, persuade, compare, explain, etc.)

### 3. Data Requirements
**Describe the data you'll need to accomplish your infographic's goal.**
- How much of that data is already available in the product proposal you're working with?
- What additional data do you think you might need to gather?
- Keep in mind that data can take a wide range of forms:
  - Statistics
  - Timelines
  - Lists or feature comparisons
  - Process flows
  - Market research
  - User demographics

Ah perfect, that makes total sense for tonight's deadline! In that case, here's a version that keeps the "NEW" label but still improves readability:

### 4. Mood Board
**Create a visual mood board that establishes your design direction.**

*Note: This is separate from the in-class mood board activity you did earlier.*

The mood board should include examples of:

- **Typography:** Fonts that would work well for your audience and message

- **Colors:** A color palette appropriate for your topic and tone

- **Images/Graphics:** Visual styles, icons, or illustrations that inspire your approach
  - **NEW 10/7/25 - Added clarification on images:**
    - Look for visual styles that match your app's purpose (e.g., if it's a fitness app: images showing activity, health, motivation)
    - Find graphics/illustrations that reflect your chosen tone (playful, professional, energetic, calming, etc.)
    - Include icons or visual elements that could work for your data presentation
    - **The key:** Your images should communicate *how* you'll visually present information about your chosen app to your target audience - reflecting both "what it's about" (the app topic) AND "how it should feel" (the tone/audience fit)

- **Reference Examples:** Other infographics or designs that influence your vision
  - **Pro tip:** Look at successful infographics in the same domain as your app for inspiration - this helps you see how others have visualized similar topics for similar audiences
