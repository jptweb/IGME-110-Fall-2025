# Overall writing advice
(I said in class we would add some do's and don't and general advice... here it is)
- Formatting and structure - headings, subheadings, bulleted and ordered lists make the content easier to read and understand
- Long blocks of unbroken text is hard to read
- Craft the proper tone - you are attempting to persuade a professional audience. Do not be too jokey or flippant. Minimal or no slang, no expletives.
- Do not use interjections - https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-an-interjection-1691178
- Less can often be more. Eliminate redundancy - https://edubirdie.com/blog/redundancy-in-writing
