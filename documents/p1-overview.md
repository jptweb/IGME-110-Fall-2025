# Project 1 - App Proposal
# Project 1 - App Proposal

## I. Overview
- For project 1 you will work in a small group and create a written proposal for an “app”
- For the purposes of the assignment, this app could be a phone or desktop app, a web site or even a physical product
- An SFW ("safe for work") topic that everyone can agree on is best - let your prof know if you are having trouble coming up with an idea

###  Some examples from last year
- *Bike Spikes* - a physical traction control solution for bicycles on winter roads
- *BetWise* - an app to help gambling addicts
- *UniAid* - a web portal that aggregates student support resources
- *Food Avenue* - a recipe finding app
- *VR Haptic Feedback Suit* - a physical product
- *Excuse Genie* - an app for generating excuses
- *Taser Bed* - a physical product that provides healthy electrical shocks, helps with oversleeping
- *Anime Soap* Lootboxes - collectible physical soap figures
- *NetPet* - a robotic companion physical product
