# App (or Product/Service) Discussion

## I. App purpose and features
- Application Definition Statement - What’s it do? Who’s it for?
- Apps should be a focused solution to a well-defined problem. Build scalpels, not Swiss Army knives
- Features should support the application definition statement
  - *OK* app def statement  - “Smart gloves that constrict and shock the user when they doom scroll too much”
  - *OK* features - gloves heat up, constrict, and lock up  when users doom scroll too much
  - Better! app def statement  - “AI-enabled gloves for users who want to be more productive in their lives”
  - Better! features - companion app for categorizing activities (encourage/discourage) and thresholds for reward/correction, Haptic feedback from gloves to signal to users when thresholds are met, quick removal and donning of gloves
  - Other features - snacking/junk food detection 
- Gemini Brainstorming - https://g.co/gemini/share/bb2030548016
- Remember that this is also App Proposal Cage Match


## II. UI Considerations
- You need to provide some UI mockups in your proposal
- You will probably follow conventions
- [Apple HIG (Human Interface Guidelines)](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/)
  - The Patterns and Components categories are probably most useful right now
- [Google Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/)
