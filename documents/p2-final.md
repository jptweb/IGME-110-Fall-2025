**NEW TIPS ADDED 10/16/25** 
- [RUBRIC FOR Project 2 Infographic](https://github.com/jptweb/IGME-110-Fall-2025/blob/main/documents/p2-Infographic-Rubric.pdf) has been added. Review this prior to submittng.

- Recreate charts and graphs for infographic if needed. As discussed in [Week 8B](https://github.com/jptweb/IGME-110-Fall-2025/blob/main/weekly/8B.md#iii-creating-cohesive-charts--graphics) you should be creating cohesive charts & graphics for your infographic. If you just copied and pasted existing charts from the app proposal; they likely don't match your color scheme and may be pixelated and hard to read. You likely need to recreate any mismatched charts using Canva or PowerPoint! Tips are located in the Week 8B Notes on how to do this.

## II. Documentation Requirements

- Update your the documentation you submitted for the [P2 draft](p2-mockup-draft.md#iii-submission-to-mycourses) - meaning your design decisions and ALL sources
- Be sure to clearly state the audience and goals of the infographic, and to explain your design decisions
- Explain how feedback you received influenced your design
- You will be also graded on your writing quality (grammar, spelling, syntax)
  
- **Note added 10/16/25:** Consider specifying the intended display context for your infographic in your documentation. For example, small typography might work well for a large-format bus station ad but would be difficult to read on a standard poster. Feel free to use your documentation to justify how your design choices align with your intended display format. This is NOT mandatory, but could assist me when I grade these if I find concerns.
