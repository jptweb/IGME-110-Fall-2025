## Rubric for P1 Product Proposal DRAFT

## 1 - Executive Summary
- The Summary/Conclusion Writer will provide  a high-level overview of the application. This section should answer the following:
  - Give us a "high concept" product statement: Meaning … *What is the application’s NAME?* *What does it DO?*
    - And … Who is the target audience? WHO is it for?
    - Example: *LevelUpLife - a social rewards service that helps college students stop Doomscrolling*
        - What key problem does it solve?
        - What are its unique features or benefits?
        
## 2 - Market Research and Need Analysis
- The Market Researcher will present the research that supports the need for the application. This section should include:
  - Gaps, unmet needs or even social ills that your application addresses
    - An analysis of existing solutions in the market (competitor analysis)
      - you may wish to have subheadings for 2 or 3 major competitors, where you detail their strengths and weakness and highlights from their reviews. Be sure to provide screenshots of these competitor apps
      - Any statistical data or qualitative evidence supporting the demand for such an application (survey results, industry reports, etc.)
      - if you made any statements above such as *"doomscrolling is a pervasive problem among high school and college students"* - you need to cite specific sources that support your claim
- Other requirements:
  - Provide charts and graphs that help to visually communicate relevant research to the reader
       
## 3 - Product Description
- The Product Designer will provide a detailed description of the application's features and how it works. This should include:
  - A list of core features, with brief explanations of each
  - How the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are designed to meet the needs of the target audience
  - Any technological innovations or creative ideas that set the application apart from others
        
## 4 - Possible Issues and Counterarguments
- The Devil’s Advocate/Critic will identify potential criticisms or challenges to the proposal. Address the following:
  - Possible objections to the need for the product (e.g., "Is this already solved by existing apps?")
    - Technical or financial challenges that could arise during development
    - How your group plans to overcome these challenges or justify the product's relevance despite challenges

## 5 - Conclusion and Recommendations
- The Summary/Conclusion Writer will summarize the main points of the proposal and reiterate why the application is needed. This section should leave a lasting impression and include:
  - A brief recap of the problem and solution
  - The potential impact of the application (social, financial, or user benefits)
  - A clear call to action (e.g., "We recommend moving forward with the development of this app because…")

## 6 - Appendix
- at least 5 citations (MLA or similar - https://zbib.org/ makes it easy)
- Additional data, charts, or research materials will be included here to support the proposal
