## What's In The Survey

The Google Form will ask you to reflect on:

### Your P3 Experience
- Overall project quality and team process
- Your specific contributions across all phases
- What you learned about prototyping, testing, and teamwork
- What you'd do differently next time

### Team Member Evaluations
- Rate each teammate (including yourself) on contribution and collaboration
- Provide specific, constructive feedback
- Highlight what they did well and areas for improvement

### Confidential Comments (Optional)
- Space to share serious concerns with instructor only

## Important Notes

**This is similar to the P1 peer evaluation process.**

**Your feedback matters:**
- Peer evaluations DO impact individual grades
- Be honest, specific, and constructive
- Use examples: "Always responded within 24 hours" not just "good communicator"
- Focus on behaviors, not personalities

**What gets shared:**
- Anonymized summary of feedback goes to teammates
- Confidential section only visible to instructor

**For complete guidance** on how to provide good feedback and how evaluations impact grades, see: [Deliverable #4 - Full Instructions](p3-peer-eval-reflection.md)

## Submission

**Where:** Individual Google Form link (emailed Monday, November 18th)

**Late Policy:** 10% penalty per day late

**Remember:** This is an individual submission, not a team submission. Take the full 30 minutes it deserves - this is 10% of your P3 grade.
