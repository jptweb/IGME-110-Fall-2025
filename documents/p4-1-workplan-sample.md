## 1. Prototype Selection

**Selected Prototype:** DormBot (Section 08, Team 2)

**Why I chose this project:**
I selected DormBot because it addresses a real problem I've experienced as a college student - keeping track of shared responsibilities in a dorm setting. The prototype has clear, well-designed screens that will translate well to video, and the concept is easy to explain quickly. The team's presentation included good visuals of the key features, which gives me strong material to work with.

The app's focus on reducing roommate conflicts through task management and communication is relatable to my target audience, and I can see several creative directions for making an engaging advertisement.

## 2. Target Audience

**Primary Target Audience:** First-year college students living in on-campus housing with roommates

**Demographics:**
- Age: 18-20 years old
- Location: Living in college dormitories, primarily first or second year students
- Tech comfort: High - grew up with smartphones, comfortable with apps
- Income: Limited (typical college student budget)

**Psychographics:**
- Stressed about balancing academics with daily life responsibilities
- Values harmony with roommates but may be conflict-averse
- Active on social media, especially TikTok and Instagram
- Responds to humor and relatable content
- Makes quick decisions - short attention span for ads

**Pain Points:**
- Passive-aggressive notes about dishes/cleaning
- Forgetting whose turn it is for shared tasks
- Awkward confrontations about chores
- Feeling like they're doing more than their fair share

**Why this audience:** This group is most likely to download and use an app like DormBot. They're experiencing the problem firsthand, they're comfortable with app-based solutions, and they're reachable through social media advertising.

## 3. Video Type & Style

**Video Type:** Problem/Solution Format (with humor)

**Why this type:** Based on the QuickFrame article, problem/solution videos are effective for apps that solve a specific pain point. By showing the "before" (roommate frustration) and "after" (harmony with DormBot), viewers immediately understand the value proposition.

**Overall Style:**
- **Tone:** Lighthearted and humorous, but not silly
- **Pacing:** Quick cuts, energetic - matching the short attention spans of my target audience
- **Visual Style:** Mix of live-action scenes (showing relatable dorm situations) and screen recordings of the app
- **Audio:** Upbeat background music, possibly a voiceover or on-screen text instead of dialogue

**Why this will work for my audience:** College students respond well to content that acknowledges their struggles with humor rather than being preachy. A too-serious approach would feel like a lecture; a funny, relatable approach feels like content they'd actually share with their roommates.
