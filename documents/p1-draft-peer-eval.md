# Project 1 - Product Proposal DRAFT - Peer Eval Process


## I. Overview
- As a group, you will look at 2 other group's P1 Product Proposal drafts and critique them
- Here is the --> [P1 Peer Eval Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11nYR3Sb2x5aQEldb_cTWHGy9yOE5ZJWc2vqFJuV-eFg/edit?usp=sharing) that contains the questions you will need to answer as a group

## II. Instructions
- You will critique one team's draft proposal at a time, each team you are assigned (see section IV. below) will be critiqued in a separate document
- Create a single feedback document in Google drive named `Feedback for team <REVIEWEE-team-number>, from team <REVIEWER-team-number>, section <your-section-number>` and make it viewable to all of RIT
- Paste in the feedback questionnaire template from the link above
- One group member is the designated scribe who will type the answers to the questions into the document
- While reading/analyzing the draft, progressing from section to section in the document, DISCUSS these questions as a group
- ANSWER these questions as a group, and the scribe will type the answers into the doc
  - too much to type? Giving the scribe an "assistant scribe" is OK!
